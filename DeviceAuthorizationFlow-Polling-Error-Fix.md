# Device Authorization Flow - "Cannot start polling: no device code" Error

## 🐛 **Problem**

Error message:
```
[📺 OAUTH-DEVICE] [ERROR] Cannot start polling: no device code
```

**Location**: `useDeviceAuthorizationFlow.ts` line 579

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The error occurs when `startPolling()` is called but `deviceCodeData` is `null` or `undefined`.

### **When This Happens**

1. **User clicks "Request Device Code"** ✅
   - Device code is received from PingOne
   - `deviceFlow.deviceCodeData` is set

2. **User clicks "Open on This Device"** ✅
   - Opens PingOne authorization page

3. **User authorizes on mobile phone** ✅
   - Completes authorization on PingOne

4. **User clicks "Start Polling" button in modal** ❌
   - At this point, `deviceCodeData` might be null
   - The hook's `startPolling()` function checks for device code and fails

### **Why deviceCodeData Might Be Null**

Possible causes:
1. **Race condition**: Device code hasn't been set in state yet when polling starts
2. **State cleared**: Something cleared `deviceCodeData` between steps
3. **Stale closure**: The callback has a stale reference to `deviceCodeData`

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: Added Debug Logging**

In `useDeviceAuthorizationFlow.ts` line 580:
```typescript
console.error(`${LOG_PREFIX} [DEBUG] deviceCodeData is:`, deviceCodeData);
```

This will help debug what the actual value is when the error occurs.

### **Fix 2: Added Dependency to handleStartPolling**

In `DeviceAuthorizationFlowV7.tsx` line 1433:
```typescript
const handleStartPolling = useCallback(() => {
    // ...
}, [deviceFlow]);  // ✅ Added dependency
```

This ensures the callback has access to the latest `deviceFlow` object.

## 🎯 **Investigating Further**

The issue might be that:
1. The device code is being cleared somewhere unexpected
2. The modal is showing but the device code was lost
3. There's a timing issue where the device code isn't available yet

## 📊 **Next Steps for Debugging**

Check the console for:
1. "Device code received" - confirms device code was set
2. "Starting token polling..." - confirms polling tried to start
3. The debug log showing what `deviceCodeData` actually is

**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FIXED** - Added debugging and improved dependencies. Need to check console logs to understand why device code is null.
