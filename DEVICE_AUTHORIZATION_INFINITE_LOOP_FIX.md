# Device Authorization Flow Infinite Loop Fix

## Issue Identified
The Device Authorization Flow was stuck in an infinite loop causing thousands of "Device code expired" and "Stopping polling" messages, overwhelming the browser console and causing performance issues.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Countdown Timer Infinite Loop
**Problem**: The countdown timer effect was calling `stopPolling()` every second once the device code expired, creating an infinite loop.

**Location**: `src/hooks/useDeviceAuthorizationFlow.ts` - countdown timer useEffect

**Fix**: Added a `hasExpired` flag to ensure the expiration logic only runs once:
```typescript
let hasExpired = false; // Flag to prevent multiple expiration calls

const interval = setInterval(() => {
    const remaining = Math.max(0, expiresAt - Date.now());
    setTimeRemaining(remaining);

    if (remaining === 0 && !hasExpired) {
        hasExpired = true; // Set flag to prevent multiple calls
        console.log(`${LOG_PREFIX} [WARN] Device code expired`);
        // ... rest of expiration logic
    }
}, 1000);
```

### 2. Redundant Stop Polling Calls
**Problem**: The `stopPolling` function was logging every time it was called, even when no polling was active.

**Fix**: Added checks to only log when actually stopping active polling:
```typescript
const stopPolling = useCallback(() => {
    // Only log and clear if actually polling to prevent spam
    if (pollingIntervalRef.current || pollingTimeoutRef.current) {
        console.log(`${LOG_PREFIX} [INFO] Stopping polling`);
    }
    // ... rest of cleanup logic
}, []);
```

### 3. Insufficient Cleanup
**Problem**: Multiple timers and intervals weren't being properly cleaned up, leading to memory leaks and multiple polling sessions.

**Fix**: Enhanced cleanup in multiple places:
- Improved `reset()` function to clear all timers
- Enhanced unmount cleanup in useEffect
- Added safeguards in `startPolling()` to clear existing intervals

### 4. Better Error Handling
**Problem**: `invalid_grant` errors weren't being handled specifically, causing confusion.

**Fix**: Added specific handling for `invalid_grant` errors:
```typescript
} else if (data.error === 'invalid_grant') {
    console.log(`${LOG_PREFIX} [ERROR] Invalid grant - device code may be expired or invalid`);
    setPollingStatus((prev) => ({
        ...prev,
        isPolling: false,
        error: 'Device code expired or invalid',
        status: 'expired',
    }));
    v4ToastManager.showError('Device code expired or invalid. Please start over.');
    return true; // Stop polling
}
```

### 5. Duplicate Request Prevention
**Problem**: Multiple device code requests could be triggered simultaneously.

**Fix**: Added checks to prevent multiple simultaneous requests:
```typescript
// Prevent multiple simultaneous requests
if (deviceCodeData && pollingStatus.status === 'polling') {
    console.warn(`${LOG_PREFIX} [WARN] Device code request already in progress`);
    return;
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/hooks/useDeviceAuthorizationFlow.ts` - Main fixes for infinite loop and cleanup
2. No changes needed to `src/pages/flows/DeviceAuthorizationFlowV6.tsx` - the component was using the hook correctly

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test device code expiration scenarios
2. Verify polling stops cleanly when device codes expire
3. Test multiple rapid clicks on "Start Polling" button
4. Verify no console spam when device codes expire
5. Test component unmounting during active polling

## Impact
- Eliminates infinite console logging
- Prevents browser performance degradation
- Improves user experience during device authorization flow
- Reduces memory leaks from uncleaned timers
- Better error messaging for expired/invalid device codes

## Notes
- React StrictMode is enabled which causes effects to run twice in development, but the fixes account for this
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- All error handling and user feedback remains intact
