## 🎓 What Was Added

A beautiful, educational **Request/Response Log** that shows each step of the `pi.flow` authentication flow in real-time.

### Features:

✅ **Visual Timeline**: Shows all 5 steps of the OAuth flow  
✅ **Color-Coded Status**: Green for success, red for errors, gray for pending  
✅ **Educational Notes**: Each step explains what's happening and why  
✅ **Request Details**: Shows HTTP method, URL, and parameters sent  
✅ **Response Details**: Shows key response fields from PingOne  
✅ **Sanitized Secrets**: Passwords and secrets are masked  
✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Log builds as the flow progresses

## 📋 What the Log Shows

### Step 1: Start Authorization Flow
```
POST https://auth.pingone.com/{envId}/as/authorize
Parameters:
  - environmentId
  - clientId
  - codeChallenge
  - responseMode: pi.flow
  - responseType: code

Note: "Request flow without credentials. PingOne will return a flow 
object with status and session tokens."

Response:
  - flowId
  - status: USERNAME_PASSWORD_REQUIRED
  - hasSessionTokens: true
```

### Step 3: Submit Credentials to Flow API
```
POST https://auth.pingone.com/.../flows/{flowId}/...
Parameters:
  - username: abc***
  - password: ***
  - sessionCookies: 2 cookies

Note: "Send username/password to Flow API with session cookies 
(interactionId + interactionToken). PingOne authenticates the user."

Response:
  - status: authenticated
  - hasResumeUrl: true
```

### Step 4: Resume Flow to Get Authorization Code
```
GET https://auth.pingone.com/.../as/resume?flowId={flowId}
Parameters:
  - flowId

Note: "After authentication succeeds, resume the flow. PingOne issues 
the authorization code directly in JSON (no redirect)."

Response:
  - code: abc123...
```

### Step 5: Exchange Authorization Code for Tokens
```
POST https://auth.pingone.com/{envId}/as/token
Parameters:
  - grant_type: authorization_code
  - code
  - code_verifier
  - redirect_uri: urn:pingidentity:redirectless
  - client_id

Note: "Standard OAuth token exchange. Send authorization code + PKCE 
verifier. PingOne returns access_token, id_token, and refresh_token."

Response:
  - access_token: received
  - id_token: received
  - refresh_token: received
  - expires_in: 3600
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Color Scheme:
- **Container**: Purple gradient background (667eea → 764ba2)
- **Step Cards**: White cards with color-coded left border
- **Success (200-299)**: Green border & badge
- **Error (400+)**: Red border & badge
- **Pending**: Gray border & badge

### Visual Elements:
- **Step Number**: Colored circle with white number
- **HTTP Method**: Color-coded badge (POST = blue, GET = green)
- **HTTP Status**: Color-coded badge (200 = green, 401 = red)
- **URL**: Monospace font, gray background
- **Parameters**: Key/value pairs in light gray boxes
- **Note**: Blue info box with educational text
- **Response**: Green success box with response data

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### State Management:
```typescript
const [flowRequestLog, setFlowRequestLog] = useState<Array<{
  step: number;
  title: string;
  method: string;
  url: string;
  params: Record<string, string>;
  response?: Record<string, string | number | boolean>;
  status?: number;
  note: string;
  timestamp: number;
}>>([]);
```

### Logging Points:
1. **Before** each request → Log request details
2. **After** each response → Update log with response & status

### Security:
- ✅ Passwords are masked as `***`
- ✅ Client secrets are masked as `***`
- ✅ Tokens are truncated (first 12 chars + `...`)
- ✅ Session cookies shown as count, not values

---

## 📱 User Experience

### When Flow Starts:
1. User clicks "Launch Redirectless Flow"
2. Log container appears at bottom of page
3. Step 1 card appears immediately (no response yet)
4. As flow progresses, response is added to Step 1
5. Steps 3, 4, 5 appear as they execute
6. Each step updates with real-time status

### After Flow Completes:
- All 5 steps visible
- All responses populated
- All status codes shown
- User can see exactly what was sent/received
- Perfect for learning and debugging!

---

## ✅ Benefits

### For Learning:
- ✅ See exactly what `pi.flow` does
- ✅ Understand the Flow API pattern
- ✅ Learn OAuth step-by-step
- ✅ See session cookie mechanics
- ✅ Understand PKCE flow

### For Debugging:
- ✅ See exactly what was sent
- ✅ See exactly what was received
- ✅ Identify where errors occur
- ✅ Verify credentials are correct
- ✅ Check HTTP status codes

### For Documentation:
- ✅ Visual proof of correct implementation
- ✅ Screenshots for docs
- ✅ Examples of real requests/responses
- ✅ Educational content built-in

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Start the flow**:
   - Navigate to PingOne Authentication page
   - Select "Redirectless Flow" mode
   - Click "Launch Redirectless Flow"

2. **Watch the log build**:
   - Step 1 appears immediately
   - HEB popup opens for credentials
   - Enter username/password
   - Steps 3, 4, 5 appear in sequence

3. **Review the log**:
   - Scroll down to see all steps
   - Check HTTP status codes (should all be 200)
   - Review educational notes
   - See masked secrets

4. **Verify correctness**:
   - Step 1: Should show `response_mode=pi.flow`
   - Step 3: Should show session cookies
   - Step 4: Should show authorization code
   - Step 5: Should show tokens received
