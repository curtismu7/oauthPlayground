echo "🔍 What this fix does:"
echo "- MFA flows now use global environment ID as fallback"
echo "- Prevents 'Environment ID is required' errors in MFA registration"
echo "- Uses synchronous localStorage access to avoid async issues"
echo "- Fallback applied when stored credentials don't have environment ID"
echo "- Proper error handling for localStorage access failures"

echo ""
echo "🔍 Expected behavior:"
echo "- MFA flows will load environment ID from global storage when missing"
echo '- SMS registration will work with global environment ID: "b9817c16-9910-4415-b67e-4ac687da74d9"'
echo "- No more "Environment ID is required and cannot be empty" errors"
echo "- Debug logs show when fallback is applied"
