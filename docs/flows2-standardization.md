# Flows2 Look-and-Feel Standardization

Tracking the rollout of the `/v2/flows/authorization-code` design language across every flows2 page.

**Status:** ✅ All 16 flows converted · **Started:** 2026-06-24 · **Reference:** [`authorizationCode.flow.tsx`](../src/flows2/flows/authorizationCode.flow.tsx)

---

## 1. The Gold Standard (reference format)

`/v2/flows/authorization-code` is the format we are standardizing on. Its defining traits:

| Trait | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Mode toggle** | `onModeChange` → `FlowContainer` renders a Real PingOne / Mock pill toggle in the header. Mock auto-fills realistic creds so it runs offline. |
| **Spec toggle** | `spec` state (`2.0`/`2.1`) as Pill buttons in the Configure step, plus an OIDC on/off pill. Teaches OAuth 2.1's stricter rules (mandatory PKCE, exact redirect match, no implicit). |
| **Design palette** | Deep indigo `#1e3a8a` + electric teal `#14b8a6`, IBM Plex Mono on action buttons / labels. |
| **Signature visual** | A distinctive inline-SVG flow diagram on the Configure step (Client → AuthZ → User → Token). |
| **Service layer** | A `mode`-aware service in `src/flows2/services/*` (real → BFF, mock → offline). |
| **Teaching copy** | Every step has `description` + `explanation`; subtitle cites the RFCs. |

---

## 2. Mode-support rule (real vs mock)

> **Rule (from product owner):** If PingOne supports the flow → ship **both Real and Mock**. If PingOne does not support it → **Mock only**.

Real mode = `onModeChange` is passed to `FlowContainer` (renders the Real/Mock toggle) and the service makes live BFF calls.
Mock only = no `onModeChange`; header shows a static "Mock" badge; service runs entirely offline.

Per-flow PingOne support is verified during conversion using the `oauth-pingone` skill. Current best understanding:

| PingOne-supported → Real + Mock | Mock only (not a PingOne capability) |
|---|---|
| authorization-code · par · device-authorization · refresh-token · client-credentials · token-introspection · token-revocation · userinfo · oidc-discovery · ropc¹ · redirectless (pi.flow) · dpop² | token-exchange³ · saml-bearer³ · implicit/hybrid⁴ |

¹ ROPC is supported by PingOne but discouraged; keep real + a deprecation callout.
² DPoP support depends on environment/app config — verify before enabling real.
³ RFC 8693 token-exchange and RFC 7522 SAML-bearer: confirm PingOne grant support per environment; default to mock until confirmed.
⁴ Implicit/hybrid: PingOne can issue tokens via the authorize endpoint, but it is discouraged under 2.1; confirm before enabling real.

**Action item:** each flow's real-mode support is re-confirmed (not assumed) at conversion time. The audit found all 15 currently *declare* real+mock; we will demote any to mock-only where PingOne genuinely does not support the grant.

## 3. Best-practice findings (research)

### 3.1 What is already shared (good)
- `FlowContainer` / `FlowStep` / `FieldGroup` / `ResultCard` / `CodeBlock` / `JsonView` / `ExplanationPanel` / `FlowResult`.
- `useFlowEngine(STEPS)` — step state, completion, navigation.
- `tokens.ts` — palette/spacing/radius (18 flows import it).
- `services/pingone.ts` — shared BFF helper; every flow has a `mode`-aware service.

### 3.2 What is duplicated / missing (the gap to close)
- The **teal accent** (`#14b8a6` / hover `#0d9488`) and **neutral scale** that *make* the reference look are **NOT in `tokens.ts`** — hand-redeclared as a local `DESIGN` object in the authz files. Converting 15 flows by copy-paste would create 15 copies.
- The signature `FlowDiagram` / `FlowLabel` wrapper and the `Pill` / `Action` / `Toggle` / `Note` styled-components live **inline only in the authz flow** — no shared home.

### 3.3 Decision: extract before converting (DRY)
1. **Extend `tokens.ts`** — add `color.accent`, `color.accentHover`, and a `neutral` scale.
2. **Shared styled-components** in `framework/` — `Pill` / `Action` / `Toggle` / `Note` (extracted from the reference, retokenized).
3. **Parameterized `FlowDiagram` component** — `<FlowDiagram label="..." nodes={['Client','AuthZ','User','Token']} />`. Each flow passes its own node list → distinct signature, **zero duplicated SVG**.
4. **Refactor the reference flow** onto the shared pieces (proves the API; stays canonical example).

### 3.4 OAuth 2.0 / 2.1 + OIDC compliance
- Authoritative guide: the `oauth-pingone` skill.
- **Spec toggle only where 2.0 and 2.1 actually differ** (grant flows). OAuth 2.1 deltas to enforce when `spec === '2.1'`: PKCE mandatory on auth-code flows, exact redirect-URI matching, no implicit/ROPC grants, refresh-token rotation.

---

## 4. Spec-toggle scope (which flows get the 2.0/2.1 toggle)

| Applies (grant flows w/ real 2.0↔2.1 deltas) | Informational only / N/A (extensions, OIDC utilities) |
|---|---|
| authorization-code ✅ · par · device-authorization · ropc · implicit-hybrid · hybrid · redirectless · refresh-token | client-credentials · token-exchange · token-introspection · token-revocation · userinfo · oidc-discovery · dpop · saml-bearer |

For the right-column flows the **signature element** is the distinctive trait, not a spec toggle.

## 5. Conversion tracker

Legend: ⬜ not started · 🟨 in progress · ✅ done (committed)

### Phase 0 — Framework extraction (foundation) ✅
- ✅ Extend `tokens.ts` (accent + neutral scale)
- ✅ Shared `Pill` / `Action` / `Toggle` / `Note` / `Grid` (`framework/primitives.tsx`)
- ✅ Parameterized `FlowDiagram` component (`framework/FlowDiagram.tsx`)
- ✅ Refactor reference `authorizationCode.flow.tsx` onto shared pieces (render verified)

### Phase 1 — Grant flows (palette + signature + spec toggle) ✅
| Flow | File | LOC | Mode | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authorization Code | authorizationCode.flow.tsx | 518 | real+mock | ✅ reference |
| PAR | par.flow.tsx | 369 | real+mock | ✅ |
| Device Authorization | deviceAuthorization.flow.tsx | 398 | real+mock | ✅ |
| Refresh Token | refreshToken.flow.tsx | 318 | real+mock | ✅ |
| ROPC | ropc.flow.tsx | 304 | real+mock¹ | ✅ |
| Implicit / Hybrid | implicitHybrid.flow.tsx | 471 | real+mock¹ | ✅ |
| Hybrid | hybrid.flow.tsx | 379 | real+mock¹ | ✅ |
| Redirectless | redirectless.flow.tsx | 430 | real+mock¹ | ✅ |

### Phase 2 — Extension / utility flows (palette + signature) ✅
| Flow | File | LOC | Mode | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Client Credentials | clientCredentials.flow.tsx | 288 | real+mock | ✅ |
| Token Exchange | tokenExchange.flow.tsx | 254 | real+mock¹ | ✅ |
| Token Introspection | tokenIntrospection.flow.tsx | 253 | real+mock | ✅ |
| Token Revocation | tokenRevocation.flow.tsx | 273 | real+mock | ✅ |
| UserInfo | userInfo.flow.tsx | 245 | real+mock | ✅ |
| OIDC Discovery | oidcDiscovery.flow.tsx | 445 | real+mock | ✅ |
| DPoP | dpop.flow.tsx | 386 | real+mock¹ | ✅ |
| SAML Bearer | samlBearerAssertion.flow.tsx | 301 | real+mock¹ | ✅ |

**🎉 All 16 flows now match the `/v2/flows/authorization-code` format.** Mock runs
fully offline on every flow; real mode wires to the PingOne BFF.

### Real-mode (PingOne support) notes ¹
Real mode is wired and kept on every flow, but these depend on PingOne app/env config and
may fail against a default worker app — mock always works for teaching:
- **ROPC** — `grant_type=password` must be explicitly enabled on the app; removed in OAuth 2.1.
- **Implicit / Hybrid** — needs `response_type=token` / `code id_token` enabled; discouraged in 2.1.
- **Redirectless** — it *is* the Authorization Code flow with one added parameter, `response_mode=pi.flow`: PingOne skips the browser redirect (no `redirect_uri` required), `/authorize` returns the authorization response as a JSON flow object, and tokens come back directly in the body. The `pi.flow` response_mode is a PingOne extension (the underlying grant is standard Authorization Code).
- **Token Exchange** — RFC 8693 needs a custom resource server + token-exchange scope.
- **DPoP** — RFC 9449 support is environment-limited.
- **SAML Bearer** — RFC 7522 needs IdP/assertion config beyond a standard worker app.
- **Refresh Token** — rotation only visible if "Refresh Token Rotation" is enabled on the app.

## 6. Per-flow process (repeat for each)
1. Confirm mode support (PingOne supported → real+mock; else mock-only).
2. Apply shared palette (`Action` / `Pill` / `Note` from framework).
3. Add a signature `<FlowDiagram>` to the first step with the flow's node sequence.
4. Add spec toggle if in Phase-1 scope; verify 2.1 deltas are enforced.
5. Verify mock runs offline and real wires to the BFF.
6. Commit (`flows2: standardize <flow> look-and-feel`), tick the box here.

## 7. Reusable step-modules & how we add new ideas easily

**Goal:** when we invent a new capability (e.g. "introspect the token"), we write it
**once** as a drop-in module and every qualifying flow gains it — no per-flow rewrite.

### 7.1 The composition model
Phase 0 gave us shared *primitives* (palette, Pill, Action, FlowDiagram). The next layer
is shared **step-modules**: self-contained components that render inside a `<FlowStep>` and
take a uniform prop shape:

```ts
interface StepModuleProps {
  token?: string;          // access/refresh/id token the module operates on
  credentials: FlowCredentials;
  mode: FlowMode;          // 'real' | 'mock'
  spec?: OAuthSpec;        // when behavior differs by 2.0/2.1
}
```

A flow composes them; adding a module to a flow is **one JSX line**. Adding a *new* module
benefits every flow that already renders the shared "Use Tokens" step (§7.3).

### 7.2 Catalog of reusable modules (build on first use, then reuse)
Legend: ✨ = high value across many flows · 🔁 = already exists inline in authz, extract it

| Module | What it does | Reuse across flows | RFC |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SpecToggle` ✅ | 2.0/2.1 + optional OIDC pills | every flow's Configure step | OAuth 2.1 |
| `CredentialsForm` ✅ | The standard Env ID / Region / Client ID / Secret / Redirect / Scope grid | ~all flows | — |
| `IntrospectPanel` ✅ | "Introspect token" action + claims view | any flow yielding an access token | RFC 7662 |
| `UserInfoPanel` ✅ | OIDC UserInfo call + claims view | any OIDC flow with an access token | OIDC Core |
| `RevokePanel` ✅ | Revoke an access/refresh token | any flow yielding a revocable token | RFC 7009 |
| `JwtDecodePanel` ✅ | Decode id_token / JWT access token (payload claims) | any flow with a JWT | RFC 7519 |
| `RefreshPanel` ✅ | Exchange a refresh_token for new tokens | grant flows returning a refresh_token | RFC 6749 §6 |
| `PkceStep` 🔁 | Generate verifier + S256 challenge, with mock stand-in | auth-code, par, hybrid, redirectless | RFC 7636 |
| `RequestPreview` ✨ | Show the raw HTTP request (copy-as-curl) for teaching | all flows | — |
| `TokenResultCard` | Standardized token display (wraps `ResultCard`/`FlowResult`) | all flows | — |

### 7.3 The "Use Tokens" extension point ✅ built
Implemented in `framework/UseTokensStep.tsx` (registry of `userinfo`/`introspect`/`revoke`/`decode`,
backed by the existing mode-aware services). Wired into the reference flow + all token-yielding flows.
Every flow that ends with tokens renders this **shared final step** built from a registry:

```tsx
<UseTokensStep
  result={result} credentials={creds} mode={mode}
  tools={['userinfo', 'introspect', 'revoke', 'decode']}  // opt-in per flow
/>
```

`UseTokensStep` maps each tool name → its panel module. **To add a brand-new idea**
(say, RFC 9449 DPoP-bound token replay), we: (1) write `ReplayPanel` once, (2) register it
in the tool map, (3) add `'replay'` to the `tools` list of whichever flows support it. No
flow file is restructured. This is how we keep "integrate new ideas easily" true over time.

### 7.4 Rollout rule (avoid speculative code)
We do **not** pre-build the whole catalog. Each module is extracted the **first time a second
flow needs it** (authz already contains PKCE/UserInfo/Introspect inline — these get promoted
to modules during the first conversion that reuses them), then reused thereafter. The catalog
above is the agreed target so extractions are consistent, not ad hoc.
