## How to Verify

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application**

3. **Check the sidebar menu:**
   - Open "OAuth 2.0 Flows" section
   - Look for green ‚úÖ next to "Implicit Flow (V5)"
   - Open "OpenID Connect" section
   - Look for green ‚úÖ next to "Implicit Flow (V5)"

4. **Test both flows:**
   - Navigate to each flow
   - Verify distinct differences in content
   - Check default scopes (empty vs openid profile email)
   - Verify warnings match flow purpose

## Next Steps

Suggested flows to migrate next:
1. OAuth Authorization Code V5
2. OIDC Authorization Code V5
3. Client Credentials V5
4. Device Authorization V5
5. OIDC Device Authorization V5
