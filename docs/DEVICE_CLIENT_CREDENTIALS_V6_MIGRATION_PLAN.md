# Device Authorization & Client Credentials V6 Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive migration plan for upgrading Device Authorization and Client Credentials flows to V6, following the same service-based architecture and professional styling implemented in other V6 flows.

## Current Status
- **Device Authorization (V5)**: Basic implementation, needs V6 upgrade
- **Client Credentials (V5)**: Basic implementation, needs V6 upgrade
- **Target**: Migrate both to V6 with full service integration

## Migration Scope

### 1. Device Authorization Flow V6 Migration

#### 1.1 Configuration File Creation
- **File**: `src/pages/flows/config/DeviceAuthorizationFlowV6.config.ts`
- **Content**: 
  - Step metadata (8 steps)
  - Section keys for collapsible sections
  - Default app configuration
  - Device-specific educational content

#### 1.2 Service Integration
- **AuthorizationCodeSharedService**: Core functionality (PKCE, auth URLs, token management)
- **ComprehensiveCredentialsService**: Unified credentials UI
- **ConfigurationSummaryService**: Compact configuration summary
- **FlowCompletionService**: Professional completion page
- **FlowSequenceService**: Visual flow diagrams
- **EnhancedApiCallDisplayService**: API call visualization

#### 1.3 Educational Content
- Device flow specific explanations
- User code display and polling mechanisms
- Token exchange process
- Security considerations for device flows

#### 1.4 Component Updates
- **File**: `src/pages/flows/DeviceAuthorizationFlowV6.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Service-based architecture
  - Professional UI styling
  - Enhanced educational content
  - V6 branding and versioning

### 2. Client Credentials Flow V6 Migration

#### 2.1 Configuration File Creation
- **File**: `src/pages/flows/config/ClientCredentialsFlowV6.config.ts`
- **Content**:
  - Step metadata (6 steps)
  - Section keys for collapsible sections
  - Default app configuration
  - Client credentials specific educational content

#### 2.2 Service Integration
- **New Service**: `clientCredentialsSharedService.ts`
  - Client credentials specific logic
  - Token endpoint handling
  - Credential validation
  - Error handling
- **ComprehensiveCredentialsService**: Unified credentials UI
- **ConfigurationSummaryService**: Compact configuration summary
- **FlowCompletionService**: Professional completion page
- **FlowSequenceService**: Visual flow diagrams
- **EnhancedApiCallDisplayService**: API call visualization

#### 2.3 Educational Content
- Client credentials flow explanations
- Machine-to-machine authentication
- No user interaction required
- Scope-based authorization
- Token lifetime management

#### 2.4 Component Updates
- **File**: `src/pages/flows/ClientCredentialsFlowV6.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Service-based architecture
  - Professional UI styling
  - Enhanced educational content
  - V6 branding and versioning

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Device Authorization V6 (Priority: High)
1. **Week 1**: Create configuration file and basic service structure
2. **Week 2**: Implement core Device Authorization service
3. **Week 3**: Integrate UI services and educational content
4. **Week 4**: Testing, refinement, and documentation

### Phase 2: Client Credentials V6 (Priority: Medium)
1. **Week 1**: Create configuration file and Client Credentials service
2. **Week 2**: Implement core Client Credentials functionality
3. **Week 3**: Integrate UI services and educational content
4. **Week 4**: Testing, refinement, and documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Shared Services to Integrate
1. **ComprehensiveCredentialsService**: âœ… Available
2. **ConfigurationSummaryService**: âœ… Available
3. **FlowCompletionService**: âœ… Available
4. **FlowSequenceService**: âœ… Available
5. **EnhancedApiCallDisplayService**: âœ… Available
6. **AuthorizationCodeSharedService**: âœ… Available (for Device Auth)
7. **ClientCredentialsSharedService**: ðŸ”„ To be created

### New Services to Create
1. **DeviceAuthorizationSharedService**: Device-specific logic
2. **ClientCredentialsSharedService**: Client credentials specific logic

### Routing Updates
- Update `src/App.tsx` with new V6 routes
- Add redirects from V5 to V6 routes
- Update sidebar navigation with V6 badges

### Sidebar Updates
- Add V6 badges to Device Authorization and Client Credentials
- Apply light green background shading
- Update tooltips with migration status

## Educational Content Requirements

### Device Authorization
- Device flow overview and use cases
- User code generation and display
- Polling mechanism explanation
- Security considerations
- Token exchange process

### Client Credentials
- Machine-to-machine authentication
- No user interaction required
- Scope-based authorization
- Token lifetime and refresh
- Security best practices

## Success Criteria
- âœ… All V6 flows use service-based architecture
- âœ… Professional UI styling consistent with other V6 flows
- âœ… Comprehensive educational content
- âœ… Full integration of shared services
- âœ… Proper V6 branding and versioning
- âœ… Light green background shading in sidebar
- âœ… Green checkmark badges
- âœ… No linter errors
- âœ… All routes working correctly

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Device Authorization V6**: 4 weeks
- **Client Credentials V6**: 4 weeks
- **Parallel Development**: Possible after Device Auth service structure is established

## Dependencies
- Existing V6 service architecture
- ComprehensiveCredentialsService
- ConfigurationSummaryService
- FlowCompletionService
- FlowSequenceService
- EnhancedApiCallDisplayService

## Risk Mitigation
- Incremental development approach
- Extensive testing at each phase
- Backup of existing V5 implementations
- Rollback plan if issues arise
- User feedback integration

## Post-Migration
- Archive V5 implementations
- Update documentation
- Create migration summary
- Plan for additional flow upgrades
- Performance optimization
