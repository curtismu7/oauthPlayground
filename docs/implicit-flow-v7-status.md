# Implicit Flow V7 Migration Status

## Overview

Planning for the unified OAuth/OIDC implicit “V7” flow is complete. Implementation work has **not** started yet, so all code in the repository still references the separate V6 pages. This document captures the agreed approach and the next steps so development can resume quickly.

## Current State

- ✅ In-depth analysis finished; implementation plan documented.
- ✅ No pending TODO items for planning.
- ✅ Workspace unchanged—no new files or partial edits beyond this document.
- ✅ Shared services (`implicitFlowSharedService.ts`, `useImplicitFlowController`) extended with V7-aware helpers.
- ✅ `ImplicitFlowV7.tsx` created with variant selector and Step 0 implementation.
- ✅ Routing, headers, sidebar, and redirect URI mapping configured for `/flows/implicit-v7`.
- ✅ Callback handler (`ImplicitCallback.tsx`) updated to recognise V7 session flags.
- ✅ V7 flow steps 1-6 implemented using existing services.
- ❌ Manual verification and testing not yet performed.

## Remaining Work

### Manual Verification & Testing
- Run both variants end to end:
  - Generate auth URL → redirect → ensure tokens are captured.
  - Token introspection, user-info fetch, reset/start-over paths.
  - Confirm modal dialogs (redirect confirmation, success) behave for both variants.
- If automation is required, add Playwright scenarios for the new variant selector flow.

## Suggested Implementation Order

1. ✅ Shared-service/controller refactor.
2. ✅ Create the new `ImplicitFlowV7.tsx` component skeleton.
3. ✅ Wire navigation, headers, and redirect mappings to point to the new flow.
4. ✅ Update callback/session storage handling.
5. Manual testing; optionally migrate V6 entries to a "Legacy" group.

This document should be the starting point for the next development session—once the steps above are completed, the V6 pages can be retired or archived.
