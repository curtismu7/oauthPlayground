        `Unified OAuth – NO-REGRESSION Fix Workflow (Windsurf)

        Repo: .
        Must follow:
        - SWE-15: SWE-15_UNIFIED_OAUTH_GUIDE.md
        - Inventory: project/inventory/UNIFIED_OAUTH_INVENTORY.md

        🛑 STOP-SHIP / NO REGRESSIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
        REGRESSION = FAILURE. If anything breaks, is uncertain, or expands blast radius, STOP and change approach.

        You MUST NOT:
        - ship a fix without proof (tests + gate passing)
        - introduce any new failing checks
        - widen behavior changes beyond the targeted path
        - add “defaults/fallbacks” that can reset flows/state unexpectedly

        You MUST:
        - choose the smallest safest fix
        - treat shared flows/services/components as HIGH RISK
        - ensure the regression gate catches this bug class going forward (fail non-zero)
        - update the inventory so this regression cannot reappear unnoticed

        If you cannot meet the above, do not proceed—explain what’s blocking (missing tests, missing gate, unclear state source) and propose a safer plan.

        1) Baseline + Scope (before any code)
        - Reproduce the bug and describe scope (apps/services/flows impacted).
        - Find the matching “issue hotspot” in project/inventory/UNIFIED_OAUTH_INVENTORY.md.
        - Propose the smallest safe fix. Call out any risky/broad changes explicitly.

        2) Clean Restart Policy (required for flow/server-impacting work)
        - From repo root run: ./run.sh -quick
        (Fallback only if missing: ./restart.sh -quick)
        - Run restart BEFORE repro (clean baseline) and AFTER fix (before final verification).
        - Confirm services healthy per the guide.

        3) Implement (minimal diff, controlled blast radius)
        - Make the smallest change that fixes the bug.
        - Do not alter behavior outside the target path.
        - If you touch shared flows/services/components, assume cross-app blast radius and treat as HIGH RISK.

        4) Verify (provide proof)
        - Run SWE-15 test/build steps.
        - Run the regression gate: ./comprehensive-inventory-check.sh (or OAuth equivalent).
        - If a check for this bug class doesn’t exist, add it and ensure it FAILS non-zero on regressions.
        - In your response include:
        - commands run (copy/paste)
        - pass/fail summary
        - files changed + why

        5) Inventory Update (so it can’t happen again)
        Update project/inventory/UNIFIED_OAUTH_INVENTORY.md with:
        - Where it arises (paths/modules)
        - Prevention commands (grep/tests) that detect this regression
        - Gate notes (CI-friendly, fail non-zero)
        - A short “how to verify” snippet

        PRODUCTION NOTE
        - For production-only changes, use project/inventory/PRODUCTION_INVENTORY.md as the source of truth.

   Unified CIBA – NO-REGRESSION Fix Workflow (Windsurf)

Repo: .
Must follow:
- SWE-15: SWE-15_UNIFIED_CIBA_GUIDE.md
- Inventory: project/inventory/UNIFIED_CIBA_INVENTORY.md

🛑 STOP-SHIP / NO REGRESSIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
REGRESSION = FAILURE. If anything breaks, is uncertain, or expands blast radius, STOP and change approach.

You MUST NOT:
- ship a fix without proof (tests + gate passing)
- introduce any new failing checks
- widen behavior changes beyond the targeted path
- add “defaults/fallbacks” that can reset flows/state unexpectedly
- change polling/interval/timeouts globally unless the change is explicitly scoped and proven safe (CIBA is timing-sensitive)

You MUST:
- choose the smallest safest fix
- treat shared flows/services/components as HIGH RISK
- ensure the regression gate catches this bug class going forward (fail non-zero)
- update the inventory so this regression cannot reappear unnoticed
- preserve protocol invariants (auth_req_id lifecycle, polling rules, error semantics, token binding if applicable)

If you cannot meet the above, do not proceed—explain what’s blocking (missing tests, missing gate, unclear state source) and propose a safer plan.

1) Baseline + Scope (before any code)
- Reproduce the bug and describe scope (apps/services/flows impacted).
- Identify which CIBA mode(s) are affected (poll, ping, push if supported).
- Find the matching “issue hotspot” in project/inventory/UNIFIED_CIBA_INVENTORY.md.
- Propose the smallest safe fix. Call out any risky/broad changes explicitly (shared OAuth client, token service, retry/backoff utilities).

2) Clean Restart Policy (required for flow/server-impacting work)
- From repo root run: ./run.sh -quick
  (Fallback only if missing: ./restart.sh -quick)
- Run restart BEFORE repro (clean baseline) and AFTER fix (before final verification).
- Confirm services healthy per the guide.

3) Implement (minimal diff, controlled blast radius)
- Make the smallest change that fixes the bug.
- Do not alter behavior outside the target path.
- If you touch shared OAuth flows/services/components, assume cross-app blast radius and treat as HIGH RISK.
- Preserve CIBA timing/error semantics:
  - polling interval/backoff behavior
  - `authorization_pending` / `slow_down` / `expired_token` (or your platform equivalents)
  - auth_req_id issuance + storage + invalidation rules

4) Verify (provide proof)
- Run SWE-15 test/build steps.
- Run the regression gate: ./comprehensive-inventory-check.sh (or CIBA equivalent).
  - If a check for this bug class doesn’t exist, add it and ensure it FAILS non-zero on regressions.
- Verification must include at least:
  - happy path (initiate backchannel auth → user completes → token issued)
  - pending path (poll before user completes → pending response behaves correctly)
  - timeout/expiry path (auth_req_id expires → correct error + no token issuance)
  - slow-down/backoff path (if supported) behaves as specified
- In your response include:
  - commands run (copy/paste)
  - pass/fail summary
  - files changed + why

5) Inventory Update (so it can’t happen again)
Update project/inventory/UNIFIED_CIBA_INVENTORY.md with:
- Where it arises (paths/modules)
- Prevention commands (grep/tests) that detect this regression
- Gate notes (CI-friendly, fail non-zero)
- A short “how to verify” snippet (including at least one pending/expiry case)

PRODUCTION NOTE
- For production-only changes, use project/inventory/PRODUCTION_INVENTORY.md as the source of truth.
