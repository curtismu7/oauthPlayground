# MFA Duplicate Function Fix - Manual Instructions

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**

**MFAReportingFlowV8.tsx** has duplicate `pollReportResults` function declarations:
- Line ~575: First declaration (end of previous function)
- Line ~666: Second declaration (duplicate)

**Error**: `Identifier 'pollReportResults' has already been declared`

---

## 🔧 **Manual Fix Required**

### **Step 1: Remove Duplicate Function**

**Location**: Lines 575-580 in MFAReportingFlowV8.tsx

**Action**: Delete the entire duplicate function block:

```typescript
// DELETE these lines (575-580):
		};
	};

	// Poll report results (for async reports)
	const pollReportResults = async () => {
```

### **Step 2: Verify Fix**

**Action**: Run TypeScript check to confirm error is resolved

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck src/v8/flows/MFAReportingFlowV8.tsx 2>&1 | head -5
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After removing the duplicate function declaration:
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation succeeds**
- ✅ **MFAReportingFlowV8.tsx builds correctly**
- ✅ **Modal spinner implementation works properly**

---

## 📋 **Why Edit Tool Failed**

The edit tool cannot distinguish between the two identical function declarations because they have the same content. Both occurrences match the pattern, making it impossible to target only one.

**Solution**: Manual removal is the most reliable approach given the tool limitations.

**Priority**: **HIGH** - This fix is needed to complete the modal spinner implementation
