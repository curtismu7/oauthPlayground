**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2024-11-23

## What Was Done

Streamlined the FIDO2 device registration and verification flow in the MFA Flow V8 to reduce user clicks and improve experience.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Auto-Advance After Registration
- After FIDO2 device registration, flow automatically skips Step 2 (OTP sending) and goes directly to Step 3 (verification)
- Saves 2 manual clicks

### 2. Progress Indicator During WebAuthn
- Added animated pulsing lock icon during WebAuthn authentication
- Shows "Waiting for WebAuthn Authentication..." message
- Provides clear visual feedback

### 3. Auto-Advance After Verification
- After successful FIDO2 authentication, flow automatically advances to success page
- Saves 1 manual click

### 4. Enhanced Toast Notifications
- Added progress toasts at key points:
  - "🔐 Preparing FIDO2 registration..."
  - "🔑 Please complete the WebAuthn registration prompt..."
  - "✅ FIDO2 device registered successfully!"
  - "🔐 Ready to verify your FIDO2 device"
  - "✅ FIDO2 device verified successfully!"

## Results

### Before:
- 11 steps total
- 6 user clicks required
- Manual navigation between every step

### After:
- 8 steps total (27% reduction)
- 3 user clicks required (50% reduction)
- Auto-advance eliminates 3 manual clicks

- Progress indicators display correctly
- Auto-advance after verification

## User Experience Impact

**Before:** User had to manually click "Next" after registration, then "Continue" through Step 2, then "Next" after verification.

**After:** User clicks "Register Device" → completes WebAuthn → **automatically jumps to verification** → clicks "Authenticate" → completes WebAuthn → **automatically shows success**.

**Result:** 50% fewer clicks, smoother flow, better feedback.
