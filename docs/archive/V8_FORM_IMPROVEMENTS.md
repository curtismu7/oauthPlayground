# V8 Form Improvements - Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Environment Field
- Removed the Development/Staging/Production radio buttons
- Simplified the form by removing unnecessary complexity
- Users can configure security settings directly in their app

### 2. ✅ App Picker Moved to Top
- **App Picker is now the FIRST section**
- When users select an app, it auto-fills:
  - Client ID
  - Redirect URI (first one from app)
  - Post-Logout Redirect URI (first one from app)
- Makes sense to discover/select app before manually entering credentials

### 3. ✅ Worker Token Management
- Added "Manage Worker Token" button in App Picker
- Checks for stored worker token automatically
- Button shows different states:
  - 🔑 **Add Worker Token** (orange) - when no token stored
  - 🔑 **Manage Token** (blue) - when token is stored
- Prompts user to add token if missing
- Allows removing stored token
- Uses shared storage from `AppDiscoveryService`

### 4. ✅ Subtle Color Coding
Each section now has its own subtle color for better visual separation:

| Section | Color | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| 📱 App Picker | Green | Discover and select apps |
| ⚡ Configuration & Credentials | Yellow/Amber | Core credentials |
| 📋 Specification & Flow Type | Indigo | OAuth/OIDC spec selection |
| 🔍 OIDC Discovery | Blue | Auto-discover configuration |
| 🔄 Redirect Configuration | Pink | Redirect URIs |
| 🚪 Logout Configuration | Purple | Logout URIs |
| 🔐 Permissions | Red | Scopes |
| ⚙️ Advanced Configuration | Violet | Advanced options |
| 📋 Additional Options | Cyan | Extra options |

### 5. ✅ Improved Readability
- Section content now has light gray background (#fafafa)
- Better contrast between sections
- Clearer visual hierarchy
- Each section is easily distinguishable

## Section Order (New)

1. **📱 Discover Applications** - Pick from PingOne apps (auto-fills credentials)
2. **⚡ Configuration & Credentials** - Client Type, App Type, IDs, Secret
3. **📋 Specification & Flow Type** - OAuth 2.0/2.1/OIDC selection
4. **🔍 OIDC Discovery** - Auto-discover from issuer URL
5. **🔄 Redirect Configuration** - Redirect URIs
6. **🚪 Logout Configuration** - Post-logout URIs
7. **🔐 Permissions** - Scopes
8. **⚙️ Advanced Configuration** - Response types, auth methods, PKCE
9. **📋 Additional Options** - Login hint, etc.

## User Flow
