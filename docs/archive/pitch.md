We are facing a new identity reality. For too long, we believed a stronger front door equaled stronger security. But today, 94% of organizations have suffered a breach in the past year because attackers don’t break in, they log in using compromised credentials and AI-driven deepfakes. Traditional MFA fails here because it is not continous, its not checked after authentication. 

Verified Trust brings together security, assurance, and fraud prevention into one clear approach. Instead of only controlling who can log in, it creates an explicit trust framework in three ways:
	•	Centralized Control: We use dynamic authorization to enforce policy across your entire infrastructure—integrating with any IdP—to block risky actions in real time, without recoding your apps.
	•	Identity Binding: We securely link a digital identity to the real person, so you know the user behind the screen is actually who they claim to be.
	•	Continuous Verification: We continuously verify identity throughout the full user journey—not just at login—so you can catch bad actors even after they get in.



We hasve real customers implementing verified trust now:

 One major retailer re-verified their workforce in just 3 days post-breach and saw a $20M revenue uplift by removing friction for legitimate customers. 

One of the largest U.S. banks now verifies every new employee’s identity during the interview process and then re-verifies on the hire date to prevent “bait-and-switch” scenarios. This approach has saved the bank millions by stopping bad actors before they can join the organization.

In today's rapidly evolving threat landscape,, AI, Deep Fakes, phishing, scattered spider,  adopting Verified Trust is not just an option; it's a necessity to safeguard your organization.
