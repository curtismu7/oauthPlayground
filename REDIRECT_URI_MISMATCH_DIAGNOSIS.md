# Redirect URI Mismatch - Diagnosis & Fix

## üîç **Problem**

**Console logs show:**
- ‚úÖ Popup opens successfully  
- ‚úÖ Auth URL generated with: `redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000/authz-callback`
- ‚ùå **Callback page never reached**
- ‚ùå No logs from `AuthorizationCallback.tsx`

## üö® **Root Cause**

**The redirect URI in the authorization request doesn't match what's configured in your PingOne OAuth client.**

When PingOne redirects back after authentication, it **silently fails** if the redirect URI doesn't match exactly.

---

## üìã **Your Current Configuration**

From the console logs:

**App is requesting:**
```
redirect_uri: https://localhost:3000/authz-callback
```

**Client ID:**
```
a4f963ea-0736-456a-be72-b1fa4f63f81f
```

**Environment ID:**
```
b9817c16-9910-4415-b67e-4ac687da74d9
```

## ‚úÖ **Fix: Update PingOne Client**

### **Step 1: Go to PingOne Console**
https://console.pingone.com/

### **Step 2: Navigate to Your Application**
1. Select Environment: `b9817c16-9910-4415-b67e-4ac687da74d9`
2. Go to: **Connections** ‚Üí **Applications**
3. Find your OAuth app (Client ID: `a4f963ea-0736-456a-be72-b1fa4f63f81f`)

### **Step 3: Check Redirect URIs**
Look at the "Redirect URIs" field. It might show:
- ‚ùå `http://localhost:3000/authz-callback` (wrong protocol)
- ‚ùå `https://localhost:3000/callback` (wrong path)
- ‚ùå `https://localhost:3000/` (wrong path)
- ‚ùå Only has implicit-callback URIs

### **Step 4: Add the Correct URI**
Add this **exact** URI to the list:
```
https://localhost:3000/authz-callback
```

**Important:**
- ‚úÖ Must be `https` (not `http`)
- ‚úÖ Must be `/authz-callback` (not `/callback` or `/oauth-callback`)
- ‚úÖ No trailing slash
- ‚úÖ Exactly as shown above

### **Step 5: Save and Test**
1. Click "Save"
2. Refresh the OAuth flow page
3. Try "Redirect to PingOne" again
4. After authentication, you should now see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ [AuthCallback] SUCCESSFUL AUTHORIZATION DETECTED
   ‚úÖ [AuthCallback] Authorization code received: XXXXXXXXXX...
   üéâ [useAuthorizationCodeFlowController] ===== POPUP CALLBACK EVENT RECEIVED =====
   ‚úÖ [OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6] Auth code received from popup
   ```

---

## üîß **Alternative: Use What's Already Configured**

If you don't want to change PingOne, you can change the app's redirect URI to match what's in PingOne.

### **Check What's Actually Configured:**

Run this in the PingOne API or check the console UI to see what redirect URIs are currently allowed.

### **Update the App:**

1. Go to the OAuth Authorization Code flow
2. In Step 0 (Credentials), update "Redirect URI" to match what's in PingOne
3. Click "Save Configuration"
4. Try the flow again

---

## üìä **How to Verify the Fix**

After updating PingOne, test the flow again and look for these logs:

### **‚úÖ Success Logs You Should See:**

```
[AuthCallback] ===== SUCCESSFUL AUTHORIZATION DETECTED =====
[AuthCallback] Authorization code received: [code]...
[AuthCallback] Is popup window? true
[AuthCallback] Active flow type: oauth-authorization-code-v6
[AuthCallback] Storing in parent window sessionStorage...
[AuthCallback] Triggering custom event in parent window...
[AuthCallback] Auto-closing popup in 2 seconds...

[useAuthorizationCodeFlowController] ===== POPUP CALLBACK EVENT RECEIVED =====
[useAuthorizationCodeFlowController] Setting auth code from popup: [code]...
[useAuthorizationCodeFlowController] Auth code SET in state

[OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6] Auth code received from popup, showing success modal
```

Then you should see:
- ‚úÖ Success modal appears
- ‚úÖ Toast: "Login Successful!"
- ‚úÖ Flow advances to Step 4 (Token Exchange)

## üéØ **Common Redirect URI Mistakes**

### **1. Protocol Mismatch**
- ‚ùå App uses `https://localhost:3000/authz-callback`
- ‚ùå PingOne has `http://localhost:3000/authz-callback`
- ‚úÖ **Must match exactly** - use `https`

### **2. Path Mismatch**
- ‚ùå App uses `/authz-callback`
- ‚ùå PingOne has `/callback` or `/oauth/callback`
- ‚úÖ **Must match exactly** - use `/authz-callback`

### **3. Trailing Slash**
- ‚ùå App uses `https://localhost:3000/authz-callback`
- ‚ùå PingOne has `https://localhost:3000/authz-callback/`
- ‚úÖ **Must match exactly** - no trailing slash

### **4. Port Number**
- ‚ùå App uses `https://localhost:3000/authz-callback`
- ‚ùå PingOne has `https://localhost/authz-callback` (missing :3000)
- ‚úÖ **Must include port** - use `:3000`

### **5. Missing from PingOne**
- ‚ùå PingOne only has implicit URIs
- ‚úÖ **Must add authorization code URI** - `/authz-callback`

---

## üîê **Why PingOne Silently Fails**

For security reasons, PingOne will NOT redirect to any URI that isn't explicitly whitelisted in the client configuration.

If the redirect URI doesn't match:
1. ‚ùå PingOne completes authentication
2. ‚ùå PingOne refuses to redirect back
3. ‚ùå User sees PingOne page (doesn't return to app)
4. ‚ùå No callback, no code, no success message

This is **by design** to prevent attackers from hijacking the authorization code by redirecting to malicious sites.

## üìù **What to Check in PingOne**

When editing your OAuth application in PingOne Console:

### **Required Settings:**

**Redirect URIs:** (Add all of these)
```
https://localhost:3000/authz-callback
https://localhost:3000/implicit-callback
https://localhost:3000/callback
http://localhost:3000/authz-callback
http://localhost:3000/implicit-callback
```

**Grant Types:** (Enable these)
- ‚úÖ Authorization Code
- ‚úÖ Implicit
- ‚úÖ Refresh Token

**Response Types:** (Enable these)
- ‚úÖ Code
- ‚úÖ Token
- ‚úÖ ID Token

**Token Endpoint Authentication Method:**
- ‚úÖ Client Secret Post (or Client Secret Basic)

---

## üöÄ **Quick Test**

After updating PingOne, run this test:

1. **Clear browser storage:**
   ```javascript
   sessionStorage.clear();
   localStorage.clear();
   ```

2. **Refresh the page**

3. **Enter credentials and generate auth URL**

4. **Click "Redirect to PingOne"**

5. **Check console** - you should now see callback logs

---

## üìû **Still Not Working?**

If you still don't see callback logs after updating PingOne:

### **Check Browser Console for Errors:**
- Look for CORS errors
- Look for "Refused to display..." errors
- Look for popup blocker messages

### **Check Network Tab:**
- Look at the last request in the popup
- Is it redirecting to `authz-callback`?
- Or is it stuck on PingOne?

### **Try Direct Navigation:**
After PingOne authentication, manually copy the URL from the popup and paste it here - does it look like:
```
https://localhost:3000/authz-callback?code=XXXXXXXXXX&state=YYYYYY
```

Or is it still on:
```
https://auth.pingone.com/...
```

**Most Likely Fix:** Add `https://localhost:3000/authz-callback` to your PingOne client's Redirect URIs! üéØ
