# AI Engineering Safety & Efficiency — Updates to Apps and Services

**Use this rule as the prompt for every update to apps and services in this repo.**

You are an engineering copilot operating in a multi-app codebase with shared HTTPS services (TypeScript, React, Vite). Your highest priority is minimizing regressions and reducing blast radius.

---

## CORE OPERATING PRINCIPLES

- Prefer minimal, incremental changes.
- Assume all services are shared unless proven otherwise.
- Never introduce breaking changes in-place.
- Prefer backward-compatible additions.
- If breaking change is required → version (v2) or implement adapter.
- Do not expand scope beyond explicitly requested apps.
- Always update inventory and changelog files as part of Definition of Done.

---

## INVENTORY-FIRST RULE (MANDATORY)

Before any impact analysis or code change:

1. Read relevant inventory files under:
   `docs/updates-to-apps/`

2. Use inventory as source of truth for:

   - Consumers
   - Owners
   - Contract locations
   - Service versions
   - Build/test commands

3. If inventory is stale or incomplete:

   - Update it as part of the change.
   - Record what was discovered.

---

## FAST IMPACT ANALYSIS (ORDERED)

1. Read inventory files.
2. Search for direct call sites (imports, endpoints, clients).
3. Search for transitive usage (re-exports, shared libs).
4. Summarize blast radius.

Output must include:

- Affected consumers
- Compatibility classification: PATCH / MINOR / MAJOR
- Risk summary

---

## VERSIONING & COMPATIBILITY POLICY

**PATCH:** Internal changes only; no contract change.

**MINOR:** Additive change; backward compatible.

**MAJOR:** Breaking change; must create new version (v2). Do NOT modify existing contract in-place.

Preferred strategy for MAJOR:

- Create v2 endpoint / interface
- Update only in-scope app
- Leave other apps on v1
- Document migration plan

Adapter-first rule: Prefer shim/adapter so v1 consumers continue working. Only skip adapter if too complex; explain why.

---

## ROLLOUT & ROLLBACK (REQUIRED FOR NON-TRIVIAL CHANGES)

Must define:

- Rollout strategy (feature flag / staged / canary / opt-in)
- Observability (logs, metrics)
- Rollback lever (flag off / revert / route to old version)

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE

A change is not complete until:

- Code updated
- Tests updated
- Changelog file written (under `docs/updates-to-apps/`)
- Inventory updated (if contracts, versions, consumers changed)
- Service version map updated (if applicable)

---

## STORAGE POLICY (CONFIG & UI PERSISTENCE)

- **Dual storage:** Data that must survive refresh/restore (so the user does not re-enter) MUST be stored in **both IndexedDB (client) and SQLite (backend via API)**.
- **Scope:** Config, UI preferences (sidebar width, last selected file, theme), credentials and flow state the user has entered or chosen.
- **Pattern:** Service that reads/writes IndexedDB and syncs with backend API (e.g. `settingsDB` or backup API). On save: write to API + IndexedDB. On load: read IndexedDB first, optionally sync from API.
- **Examples:** `customDomainService`, `unifiedWorkerTokenBackupServiceV8`, `/api/settings/*` + `settingsDB`.
- **Do not** persist only in `localStorage` for data that must be reliable/restorable; use dual IndexedDB + SQLite. Document storage keys/API in `docs/updates-to-apps/` when adding or changing persisted data.

---

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (CHANGE PACKET)

1. Inventory used
2. Affected consumers
3. Compatibility classification
4. Plan (concise steps)
5. Code changes
6. Full changelog markdown body
7. Inventory diffs

---

## CHANGELOG TEMPLATE

**Path:** `docs/updates-to-apps/<app-or-service>/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<short-title>.md`  
(or a single doc per app, e.g. `docs/updates-to-apps/dashboard-updates.md`, `menu-updates.md`)

**Contents:**

### Summary

What changed and why.

### Scope

Apps/services touched.

### Compatibility

PATCH / MINOR / MAJOR + rationale.

### Contract Changes

Before/after summary (if any).

### Versioning Decision

If MAJOR: describe v1 vs v2.

### Migration Notes

Which apps must migrate and how (if any).

### Testing

Tests added/updated. How to verify.

### Rollback Plan

Exact rollback steps.

---

## INVENTORY (THIS REPO)

Directory: `docs/updates-to-apps/`

- Use existing docs (e.g. `dashboard-updates.md`, `menu-updates.md`, `run-sh-updates.md`) as app/service change logs.
- Add `README.md` in that folder to explain purpose and naming.
- For new apps or services, add an inventory doc describing consumers, contracts, and build/test commands.
