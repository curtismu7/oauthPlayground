# Token Shows "Inactive" - Debugging Steps

## Current Status
✅ Frontend sending introspection request correctly
✅ Backend proxy working (200 OK response)  
✅ PingOne receiving and processing the request
❌ PingOne returning `{ "active": false }`

## Your Configuration
```
Environment ID: b9817c16-9910-4415-b67e-4ac687da74d9
Client ID: a4f963ea-0736-456a-be72-b1fa4f63f81f
Introspection Endpoint: https://auth.pingone.com/b9817c16-9910-4415-b67e-4ac687da74d9/as/introspect
Auth Method: client_secret_post
```

## Most Common Issue: Client ID Mismatch

### The Problem
PingOne's introspection endpoint has a security rule:
- **Only the client that issued a token can introspect it**
- OR a client needs special "introspection" permissions

### How to Check
1. **Look at your tokens** - When you got the access token in Step 4, what client ID was used?
2. **Compare** - Is it the SAME client ID as above (`a4f963ea...`)?

### How This Happens
You might have:
1. Saved credentials with Client A
2. Got a token using Client A  
3. Later changed credentials to Client B
4. Tried to introspect with Client B → FAILS

### Solution
**Use the SAME client ID for the ENTIRE flow:**
1. Go back to Step 1
2. Make sure credentials are: `a4f963ea-0736-456a-be72-b1fa4f63f81f`
3. Click "Reset Flow"
4. Go through flow again with these credentials
5. Don't change credentials mid-flow

## Other Possible Issues

### Issue 2: PingOne Client Configuration
The client might not have introspection enabled.

**Check in PingOne Admin:**
1. Applications → Your App (`a4f963ea...`)
2. Configuration tab
3. Look for "Token Introspection" capability
4. Make sure it's enabled

### Issue 3: Token Expired
Even though you just got it, check the token's `exp` claim.

**To decode the token:**
1. Copy your access token
2. Go to https://jwt.io
3. Paste the token
4. Check the `exp` field (it's a Unix timestamp)
5. Compare to current time

### Issue 4: Different Environment
Make sure you're introspecting in the same PingOne environment where the token was issued.

## Next Steps

### 1. Check Server Logs
Look at your terminal where `node server.js` is running. Find:
```
[Introspect Token] Response from PingOne: { status: 200, body: {...} }
```

The body might have additional error info.

### 2. Test with PingOne API Directly
Use cURL to test:
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://auth.pingone.com/b9817c16-9910-4415-b67e-4ac687da74d9/as/introspect' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  -d 'client_id=a4f963ea-0736-456a-be72-b1fa4f63f81f' \
  -d 'client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
```

### 3. Check Token in PingOne Admin
1. PingOne Admin Console
2. Applications → Your App
3. Sessions (if available)
4. See if there are any active sessions/tokens

## Most Likely Fix

**99% of the time, this is solved by:**
1. Click "Reset Flow" button
2. Make sure Step 1 has the correct client ID
3. Don't change credentials during the flow
4. Complete the flow start-to-finish with ONE set of credentials

The token introspection functionality is working correctly - it's just a configuration/credential mismatch issue!
