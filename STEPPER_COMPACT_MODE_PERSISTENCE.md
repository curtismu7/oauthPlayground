# StepNavigationButtons Compact Mode Persistence

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Component:** `src/components/StepNavigationButtons.tsx`  
**Feature:** Save compact mode state to localStorage

## Issue

User requested: "lets save the size of V5 stepper in storage, so it stays across refreshes"

The StepNavigationButtons component (V5 stepper) has a compact/expand toggle, but the state was not persisted across page refreshes. Every time the user refreshed, it would reset to full size.

## Solution

Added localStorage persistence for the `isCompact` state.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Load from localStorage on Mount

**Before:**
```typescript
const [isCompact, setIsCompact] = useState(false);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Load compact mode from localStorage on mount
const [isCompact, setIsCompact] = useState(() => {
    try {
        const saved = localStorage.getItem('stepper-compact-mode');
        return saved === 'true';
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('[StepNavigationButtons] Failed to load compact mode from localStorage:', e);
        return false;
    }
});
```

#### 2. Save to localStorage on Change

**Added:**
```typescript
// Save compact mode to localStorage whenever it changes
useEffect(() => {
    try {
        localStorage.setItem('stepper-compact-mode', isCompact.toString());
        console.log('[StepNavigationButtons] Saved compact mode to localStorage:', isCompact);
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('[StepNavigationButtons] Failed to save compact mode to localStorage:', e);
    }
}, [isCompact]);
```

## Storage Key

**Key:** `stepper-compact-mode`  
**Values:** `'true'` or `'false'` (string)  
**Location:** localStorage (persists across sessions)

## User Experience

### Before:
1. User toggles stepper to compact mode
2. User navigates around or refreshes page
3. ‚ùå Stepper resets to full size

### After:
1. User toggles stepper to compact mode
2. User navigates around or refreshes page
3. ‚úÖ Stepper stays in compact mode
4. User can toggle back to full size
5. ‚úÖ That preference is also saved

## Benefits

‚úÖ **User preference persisted** across page refreshes  
‚úÖ **Global setting** - applies to all flows  
‚úÖ **Automatic save** - no manual "save" button needed  
‚úÖ **Error handling** - graceful fallback if localStorage fails  
‚úÖ **Debug logging** - can see what's being saved/loaded  

## Testing

1. Open any flow with StepNavigationButtons
2. Click the compact/expand toggle button
3. Refresh the page
4. **Verify:** Stepper is in the same mode you left it
5. Toggle to the other mode
6. Navigate to a different flow
7. **Verify:** Stepper maintains the same mode
8. Close browser and reopen
9. **Verify:** Stepper still maintains the preference

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  
**Linter Errors:** 0  
**Impact:** All flows using StepNavigationButtons  

**The V5 stepper now remembers your size preference across refreshes!** üéØ
