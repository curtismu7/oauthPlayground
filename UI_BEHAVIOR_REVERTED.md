# UI Behavior Settings - REVERTED

## What Was Removed

All UI Behavior Settings implementation has been completely reverted:

### 1. autoAdvanceSteps - REMOVED
- Removed parameter from `AuthorizationCodeFlowControllerOptions`
- PKCE codes now ALWAYS auto-load from sessionStorage (original behavior)
- Credentials now ALWAYS auto-load from storage (original behavior)
- No more checks for the setting

### 2. collapsibleDefaultState - REMOVED
- Collapsible sections use original default state
- No UI setting control

### 3. showApiCallExamples - NEVER IMPLEMENTED
- Was planned but never added

## Files Reverted

**Controller**: 
- `src/hooks/useAuthorizationCodeFlowController.ts`
  - Interface: Removed `autoAdvanceSteps` parameter
  - PKCE loading: Back to original auto-load logic
  - Credential loading: Back to original auto-load logic

**V6 Flows**:
- `src/pages/flows/OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx`
- `src/pages/flows/OIDCAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx`
- `src/pages/flows/RARFlowV6_New.tsx`
- `src/pages/flows/PingOnePARFlowV6_New.tsx`
  - All removed: `autoAdvanceSteps: uiSettings.autoAdvanceSteps` parameter

## Current Behavior

✅ PKCE codes auto-load from sessionStorage (like before)
✅ Credentials auto-load from credentialManager (like before)
✅ Collapsible sections use original defaults (like before)
✅ Everything works as it did BEFORE the UI Behavior Settings changes

## What Remains

The following unrelated fixes remain in place:
- ✅ Double popup modal fix
- ✅ Token introspection auth method fix
- ✅ V5 stepper size reset fix
- ✅ AdvancedParametersV6 error fix

## UI Settings Modal

The UI Settings Modal still exists with the 3 behavior settings:
- Auto-advance Steps
- Collapsible Sections
- Show API Call Examples

BUT they don't do anything now. They're just UI placeholders.

## Summary

Everything is back to normal. The app should work exactly as it did before attempting to implement UI Behavior Settings.
