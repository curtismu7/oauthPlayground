# Redirect URI Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Error Reported
```
code: INVALID_DATA
details:
  code: INVALID_VALUE
  target: redirect_uri
  message: Redirect URI mismatch
```

## Root Cause: ‚ùå Wrong Client ID

**The error message was misleading!** It said "Redirect URI mismatch" but the actual problem was an invalid/wrong Client ID.

### Why This Happens

When PingOne receives an OAuth request with an incorrect Client ID:

1. **PingOne looks up the application** using the `client_id` parameter
2. **Application not found** (because Client ID is wrong/invalid)
3. **Can't validate redirect_uri** (no application = no registered redirect URIs)
4. **Returns error**: `INVALID_VALUE` on `redirect_uri` field

The error targets `redirect_uri` because PingOne is trying to validate it but can't find the application configuration to check against.

### What Was Actually Correct ‚úÖ

- **Redirect URI**: `https://localhost:3000/authz-callback` ‚úÖ
- **Code generation**: Working perfectly ‚úÖ
- **PingOne configuration**: Properly configured ‚úÖ
- **Protocol (https)**: Correct ‚úÖ
- **No trailing slash**: Correct ‚úÖ

### What Was Wrong ‚ùå

- **Client ID**: User was using wrong/invalid Client ID ‚ùå

## Solution

### Step 1: Get Correct Client ID from PingOne

1. Log in to **PingOne Console**
2. Navigate to: **Applications** ‚Üí **[Your Application]**
3. Go to: **Configuration** tab
4. Copy the **Client ID** (UUID format, like `abc123-def456-...`)

### Step 2: Update Credentials in Flow

1. Open the OAuth flow in the playground
2. Go to **Step 0: Credentials**
3. Update the **Client ID** field with the correct value
4. Save credentials
5. Try generating authorization URL again

### Step 3: Verify

After updating:
- Authorization URL generation should work ‚úÖ
- Redirect to PingOne should work ‚úÖ
- Callback should work ‚úÖ
- No more "Redirect URI mismatch" error ‚úÖ

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Error Messages Can Be Misleading
PingOne's error said "Redirect URI mismatch" but the real issue was Client ID.

**Why?** Because the validation chain is:
1. Validate Client ID exists ‚Üí ‚ùå FAILED HERE
2. Validate redirect_uri matches app config ‚Üí Can't check (no app found)
3. Return error on redirect_uri (even though Client ID was the problem)

### 2. Always Check Client ID First
When debugging OAuth errors, verify in this order:
1. ‚úÖ **Client ID** - Is it correct?
2. ‚úÖ **Environment ID** - Right environment?
3. ‚úÖ **Redirect URI** - Matches PingOne?
4. ‚úÖ **Client Secret** - Correct for token exchange?

### 3. Audit Logging Helped
The audit logging we added would have shown:
```
üîç [REDIRECT URI AUDIT] Authorization Request: {
  configuredRedirectUri: "https://localhost:3000/authz-callback",  // ‚úÖ Correct
  protocol: "https",  // ‚úÖ Correct
  windowOrigin: "https://localhost:3000",  // ‚úÖ Correct
  ...
}
```

Everything would show ‚úÖ except the authorization would fail - pointing to credentials issue.

## Files Updated During Investigation

1. ‚úÖ `REDIRECT_URI_AUDIT.md` - Comprehensive analysis
2. ‚úÖ `REDIRECT_URI_DEBUG_STEPS.md` - Testing guide
3. ‚úÖ `SAML_BEARER_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md` - Bonus compliance check
4. ‚úÖ `src/hooks/useAuthorizationCodeFlowController.ts` - Added audit logging
5. ‚úÖ This file - Resolution documentation

## Status: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Wrong Client ID
**Solution**: Update with correct Client ID from PingOne
**Time to Fix**: < 1 minute (once identified)

## Quick Reference: PingOne Application Settings

To avoid this in the future, here's where to find all the required credentials:

**PingOne Console ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí [Your App] ‚Üí Configuration**

| Field | Location | Format | Example |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| Environment ID | URL or Settings | UUID | `b9817c16-9910-4415-b67e-...` |
| Client ID | Configuration tab | UUID | `abc12345-def6-7890-...` |
| Client Secret | Configuration tab | String | `xY1Z2a3B...` (click to reveal) |
| Redirect URIs | Configuration tab | URL list | `https://localhost:3000/authz-callback` |
| Grant Types | Configuration tab | Checkboxes | Authorization Code, Refresh Token, etc. |

**All fields must match exactly!**
