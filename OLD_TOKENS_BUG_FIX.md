# Old Tokens Bug Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CollapsibleHeader.getHeader is not a function
**Error:**
```
TypeError: CollapsibleHeader.getHeader is not a function
at EnhancedApiCallDisplay (EnhancedApiCallDisplay.tsx:517:22)
```

**Root Cause:**
I attempted to refactor `EnhancedApiCallDisplay` to use a non-existent `.getHeader()` method on the `CollapsibleHeader` service. The service exports React components, not utility functions.

**Fix:**
Reverted `src/components/EnhancedApiCallDisplay.tsx` back to the original implementation, which already had perfectly functional collapsible sections. The component doesn't need to use the `CollapsibleHeader` service - its custom sections work great as-is.

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - File reverted to working state

### 2. OAuth Authorization Code Flow Showing Old Tokens
**Issue:**
OAuth Authorization Code flow (Step 4: Token Exchange) was displaying old/cached tokens before the token exchange actually happened, showing stale data to users.

**Root Cause:**
Line 2429 in `OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx` was using an undefined variable `tokens` instead of `controller.tokens`:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Using undefined "tokens" variable
{UnifiedTokenDisplayService.showTokens(
    tokens,  // <-- This was undefined or stale!
    'oauth',
    'oauth-authorization-code-v6',
    {
        showCopyButtons: true,
        showDecodeButtons: true,
    }
)}
```

The variable `tokens` was defined on line 1405 as:
```typescript
const tokens = shouldDisplayTokens ? controller.tokens : null;
```

But this was a stale memoized value that didn't update when the token exchange happened.

**Fix:**
**File:** `src/pages/flows/OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx`

1. **Line 2429:** Changed `tokens` to `controller.tokens` for direct access
2. **Line 1405:** Removed the unused `tokens` variable declaration

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Using live controller.tokens directly
{UnifiedTokenDisplayService.showTokens(
    controller.tokens,  // <-- Always shows current tokens!
    'oauth',
    'oauth-authorization-code-v6',
    {
        showCopyButtons: true,
        showDecodeButtons: true,
    }
)}
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Now displays fresh tokens immediately after exchange

### 3. OIDC Authorization Code Flow - Same Token Issue
**Issue:**
OIDC Authorization Code flow had the exact same bug as OAuth - showing old tokens from a stale variable.

**Root Cause:**
Line 2433 in `OIDCAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx` was also using undefined `tokens` variable:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE
{UnifiedTokenDisplayService.showTokens(
    tokens,  // <-- Undefined variable!
    'oidc',
    'oidc-authorization-code-v6',
    ...
)}
```

**Fix:**
**File:** `src/pages/flows/OIDCAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx`

**Line 2433:** Changed `tokens` to `controller.tokens`

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER
{UnifiedTokenDisplayService.showTokens(
    controller.tokens,  // <-- Live data!
    'oidc',
    'oidc-authorization-code-v6',
    ...
)}
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Now displays fresh tokens immediately after exchange

---

## Why This Happened

The issue was introduced when we added API call tracking to the flows. The original code used a memoized `tokens` variable, but when refactoring, the variable reference wasn't updated properly, causing it to display stale data.

## Benefits

✅ **No More Stale Tokens:** Users now see the actual tokens immediately after exchange  
✅ **Real-Time Updates:** Token display is always in sync with controller state  
✅ **Consistent UX:** Both OAuth and OIDC flows behave identically  
✅ **Cleaner Code:** Removed unnecessary intermediate variable

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/components/EnhancedApiCallDisplay.tsx` - Reverted (no changes needed)
2. ✅ `src/pages/flows/OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx` - Fixed line 2429, removed line 1405
3. ✅ `src/pages/flows/OIDCAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx` - Fixed line 2433

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] OAuth Authorization Code - Step 4: Tokens show ONLY after exchange button is clicked
- [ ] OAuth Authorization Code - Step 4: Tokens update immediately after exchange
- [ ] OIDC Authorization Code - Step 4: Tokens show ONLY after exchange button is clicked
- [ ] OIDC Authorization Code - Step 4: Tokens update immediately after exchange
- [ ] No old/cached tokens are displayed before token exchange
- [ ] Token introspection works correctly with fresh tokens
- [ ] UserInfo fetch works correctly with fresh access token

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Issue:** Old tokens displayed before token exchange  
**Root Cause:** Undefined `tokens` variable referencing stale memoized data  
**Resolution:** Use `controller.tokens` directly for real-time token display  
**Flows Fixed:** OAuth Authorization Code V6, OIDC Authorization Code V6
