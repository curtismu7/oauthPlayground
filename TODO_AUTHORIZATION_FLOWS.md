# TODO: Authorization Flows - Remaining Work

## 🎯 **Current Status**
- ✅ Modal button stuck - **FIXED**
- ✅ Popup callback detection - **FIXED**
- ✅ Success modal for OAuth/OIDC/PAR/RAR - **FIXED**
- ✅ Bright orange theme for all flows - **FIXED**
- ✅ All flows checked for issues - **COMPLETE**
- ⚠️ Testing incomplete
- ⚠️ Some flows need success modal added

---

## 📋 **Immediate TODO (Priority 1)**

### **1. Test All Fixed Authorization Flows** ⚠️
**Status:** Not tested  
**Flows to test:**
- OAuth Authorization Code V6
- OIDC Authorization Code V6
- PAR Flow V6 (New)
- RAR Flow V6 (New)

**For each flow, verify:**
- [ ] Bright orange credentials section is visible
- [ ] Modal appears when clicking "Redirect to PingOne"
- [ ] Button doesn't get stuck on "Opening..."
- [ ] Popup opens successfully
- [ ] Authentication at PingOne works
- [ ] Popup shows success message
- [ ] Popup auto-closes after 2 seconds
- [ ] **Success modal appears in parent window** ✅
- [ ] **Flow auto-advances to token exchange** ✅
- [ ] Token exchange works
- [ ] UserInfo works (OIDC flows only)
- [ ] "Start Over" button works
- [ ] "Reset Flow" button works

---

### **2. Add Success Modal to OIDC Hybrid Flow V6**
**Status:** ⚠️ Not implemented  
**File:** `src/pages/flows/OIDCHybridFlowV6.tsx`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Check if flow has `LoginSuccessModal` component
- [ ] Add `showLoginSuccessModal` state if missing
- [ ] Add useEffect to detect auth code from popup (use the NEW pattern)
- [ ] Add LoginSuccessModal component to JSX
- [ ] Test popup → success modal → token exchange flow

**Code pattern to use:**
```typescript
const [showLoginSuccessModal, setShowLoginSuccessModal] = useState(false);
const [localAuthCode, setLocalAuthCode] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Show success modal when auth code is received from popup
useEffect(() => {
    if (controller.authCode && controller.authCode !== localAuthCode) {
        console.log('✅ [OIDCHybridFlowV6] Auth code received from popup, showing success modal');
        setLocalAuthCode(controller.authCode);
        setShowLoginSuccessModal(true);
        v4ToastManager.showSuccess('Login Successful! You have been authenticated with PingOne.');
        setCurrentStep(4); // Token exchange step
    }
}, [controller.authCode, localAuthCode]);
```

---

### **3. Check Redirectless Flow V6**
**Status:** ⚠️ Unknown - needs investigation  
**File:** `src/pages/flows/RedirectlessFlowV6_Real.tsx`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Determine if Redirectless uses popup authentication
- [ ] If yes, check if it uses `AuthenticationModalService`
- [ ] If yes, add success modal logic
- [ ] If no, document why it's different
- [ ] Test the flow end-to-end

**Questions to answer:**
- Does Redirectless use popup window for auth?
- Does it use the `AuthenticationModalService`?
- Does it need callback detection?
- What's the user experience after authentication?

---

## 📋 **Secondary TODO (Priority 2)**

### **4. Standardize Modal Across V5 Flows**
**Status:** ⚠️ Not started  
**V5 Flows:**
- `OIDCAuthorizationCodeFlowV5.tsx`
- `OIDCHybridFlowV5.tsx`
- `RARFlowV5.tsx`
- `RedirectlessFlowV5_Mock.tsx`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Check if V5 flows use modal or direct redirect
- [ ] Decide: Should V5 flows be updated or left as-is?
- [ ] If updating: Apply same fixes as V6 flows
- [ ] If leaving: Document why (e.g., "V5 is legacy")

**Decision needed:** Should V5 flows be updated or deprecated?

---

### **5. Add Success Modal to Other Authorization Flows**
**Status:** ⚠️ Not started

**Flows to check:**
- [ ] `PingOnePARFlowV6.tsx` (old version - check if still used)
- [ ] `RARFlowV6.tsx` (old version - check if still used)
- [ ] `PingOneMFAFlowV5.tsx` (if it uses authorization code pattern)

**Questions:**
- Are the "old" versions (`*V6.tsx` vs `*V6_New.tsx`) still in use?
- Should old versions be deleted or updated?

---

### **6. Improve Callback Page**
**Status:** ⚠️ Enhancement  
**File:** `src/pages/AuthorizationCallback.tsx`

**Current issues:**
- Still shows debug message: "Popup will NOT close automatically"
- Could have better error handling
- Could show loading state while processing

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Remove debug mode comments
- [ ] Add loading spinner while processing
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add retry button if callback fails
- [ ] Add "Close Window" button as fallback

---

### **7. Update Comprehensive Guide**
**Status:** ⚠️ Partially complete  
**File:** `AUTHZ_FLOWS_COMPREHENSIVE_GUIDE.md`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add section on Redirectless Flow
- [ ] Update flow count (include Redirectless)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section with common issues
- [ ] Add FAQ section
- [ ] Add video/screenshot walkthrough (optional)

---

### **8. Create Testing Automation**
**Status:** ⚠️ Not started

**Idea:** Create automated tests for popup flows

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research: Can Playwright/Cypress handle popup windows?
- [ ] Create test script for OAuth Authorization Code flow
- [ ] Create test script for OIDC Authorization Code flow
- [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline (if applicable)

**Challenges:**
- Need real PingOne credentials for testing
- Need to handle actual PingOne login page
- Popup window detection in test frameworks

---

## 📋 **Nice to Have (Priority 3)**

### **9. Add Visual Indicator for Popup Waiting**
**Status:** 💡 Idea

**Current:** No indication that app is waiting for popup  
**Proposed:** Show badge/indicator while popup is open

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Design visual indicator (badge, banner, or modal overlay)
- [ ] Add state to track if popup is open
- [ ] Show indicator when popup opens
- [ ] Hide indicator when popup closes or callback received
- [ ] Add timeout warning if user doesn't complete auth

**Mockup:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⏳ Waiting for authentication...   │
│  Complete login in the popup window │
│  [Cancel]                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### **10. Add "Open in New Tab" Option**
**Status:** 💡 Idea

**Why:** Some browsers aggressively block popups

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add option in authentication modal: "Open in Popup" vs "Open in New Tab"
- [ ] Save user preference
- [ ] Handle new tab scenario (different callback handling)
- [ ] Test both modes

---

### **11. Improve Error Handling**
**Status:** 💡 Enhancement

**Current issues:**
- Generic error messages
- No guidance on fixing issues
- Errors not always visible

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create error catalog with solutions
- [ ] Add contextual help for each error
- [ ] Show errors more prominently
- [ ] Add "Copy Error Details" button for support

**Example errors to improve:**
- "Invalid Redirect URI" → Show what was sent vs what's configured
- "Popup blocked" → Show instructions to allow popups
- "Missing auth code" → Explain possible causes

---

### **12. Add Flow Health Check**
**Status:** 💡 Idea

**Concept:** Pre-flight check before starting flow

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create health check function
- [ ] Check: Are credentials valid?
- [ ] Check: Is redirect URI whitelisted?
- [ ] Check: Can we reach PingOne endpoints?
- [ ] Check: Are popups allowed?
- [ ] Show results before flow starts
- [ ] Provide fix suggestions for failures

---

### **13. Add Metrics/Analytics**
**Status:** 💡 Idea

**Why:** Understand which flows are used, where users struggle

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Decide on analytics tool (local only, privacy-preserving)
- [ ] Track: Flow starts
- [ ] Track: Flow completions
- [ ] Track: Error rates
- [ ] Track: Drop-off points
- [ ] Create dashboard (optional)

**Privacy:** Keep all data local, no external tracking

---

## 🚫 **Out of Scope / Won't Do**

### **Leave Implicit Flow Alone**
- ✅ User explicitly requested to leave Implicit flow unchanged
- Implicit flows work differently (tokens in fragment, not code exchange)
- They don't need the authorization code popup fixes

### **V3 Flows**
- Decision needed: Update or deprecate?
- Likely candidates for deprecation in favor of V6

---

## 📝 **Notes**

### **Key Decisions Needed**
1. Should we update V5 flows or leave them as legacy?
2. Should we delete old V6 versions (`*V6.tsx` vs `*V6_New.tsx`)?
3. Should we create automated tests for popup flows?
4. What's the priority for enhancements (visual indicators, error handling, etc.)?

### **Blockers**
- None currently

### **Dependencies**
- Testing requires valid PingOne environment
- Some enhancements may require design review
