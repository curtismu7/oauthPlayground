# Device Authorization Flow - Not Detecting Mobile Phone Authorization

## üêõ **Problem**

The flow is not detecting when the user authorizes from their mobile phone. The polling continues but never receives the success response.

## üîç **Analysis**

### **Current Implementation**

The polling logic in `useDeviceAuthorizationFlow.ts` is correctly implemented:

1. **Lines 614-627**: Polling starts when `startPolling()` is called
2. **Lines 390-398**: Handles RFC 8628 responses:
   - `authorization_pending` - User hasn't authorized yet (continues polling)
   - `slow_down` - Server requests slower polling
   - `access_denied` - User denied authorization (stops polling)
   - `expired_token` - Device code expired (stops polling)
   - Success with `access_token` - Stops polling and sets tokens

### **Expected Behavior**

When user authorizes on mobile phone:
1. Mobile phone POSTs to PingOne authorization endpoint
2. User approves authorization
3. PingOne marks the device code as authorized
4. Next poll returns tokens instead of `authorization_pending`
5. Flow receives tokens and stops polling

### **Possible Issues**

**Issue 1: Polling Not Started**
- Check console logs for: `[üì∫ OAUTH-DEVICE] [INFO] Starting token polling...`
- If not seen, `startPolling()` is not being called

**Issue 2: Wrong Application**
- Mobile phone might be authorizing against a different PingOne application
- Verify the application Client ID matches

**Issue 3: Timeout**
- Device code might expire before user authorizes
- Check the countdown timer in the UI

**Issue 4: Network/CORS**
- Check browser console for network errors
- Check for CORS errors from PingOne API

**Issue 5: Stale Closure**
- The `pollForToken` callback uses `pollingStatus.attempts` which might be stale
- However, the code updates state with `prev => prev.attempts + 1` which should fix this

## ‚úÖ **Debugging Steps**

### **Check Console Logs**

Look for these logs when polling:

```
[üì∫ OAUTH-DEVICE] [INFO] Starting token polling...
[üì∫ OAUTH-DEVICE] [INFO] Polling attempt 1/60
[üì∫ OAUTH-DEVICE] [INFO] Authorization pending (attempt 10/60) - waiting for user authorization...
```

### **Check if Polling is Active**

Look for these status indicators:
- `pollingStatus.isPolling: true`
- `pollingStatus.status: 'polling'`
- Attempt counter increments

### **Check PingOne Response**

After user authorizes on mobile, you should see:
```
[üì∫ OAUTH-DEVICE] [INFO] ‚úÖ Authorization complete! Tokens received
```

### **Verify Application Configuration**

1. Check the PingOne application:
   - ‚úÖ Application supports "Device Authorization" grant type
   - ‚úÖ Application client ID matches the one in credentials
   - ‚úÖ Application environment ID is correct

2. Verify the device code was used:
   - User scanned QR code correctly
   - User entered user code correctly
   - Authorization was approved

## üéØ **Most Likely Causes**

1. **Polling Not Started** - User clicked "Request Device Code" but never clicked "Start Polling"
2. **Wrong Application** - Different PingOne application than expected
3. **Device Code Expired** - User took too long to authorize
4. **Authorization Not Completed** - User didn't actually authorize on mobile

## üìä **Recommendations**

### **Add More Debugging**

Add console logging for when tokens are received:

```typescript
if (response.ok && data.access_token) {
    console.log(`${LOG_PREFIX} [INFO] ‚úÖ Authorization complete! Tokens received`);
    console.log(`${LOG_PREFIX} [INFO] Token type: ${data.token_type}`);
    console.log(`${LOG_PREFIX} [INFO] Has refresh token: ${!!data.refresh_token}`);
    // ... rest of success handling
}
```

### **Verify Polling Status**

Check the UI for polling status:
- Is the "Polling" indicator shown?
- Is the attempt counter incrementing?
- Does the polling stop button work?

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS DEBUGGING** - Check console logs and verify polling is started and active.
