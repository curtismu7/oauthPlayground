1) Need to ask what redirect URI and what Token auth they want to use
2) If there is only 1 TOken auth allowed (liek implicit only does None) then do not ask. 



Jwt Bearer flow, not using standard header like implicit
JWT bearer needs to be upgraded to V7
JWT Bearer needs to have defaults so the user does not have to type, like audience
JWT Bearer Issuer I don't thik should be clientID
JWT Bearer - Token Endpoint Configuration needs to be moved above "Worker Token Required for Config Checker" section

RAR - is talking about SAML Bearer flow, focus on RAR: SAML Bearer Assertion Flow - Educational Mock
This flow is a mock/educational implementation because PingOne does not support SAML Bearer assertions. However, this flow is widely used in enterprise OAuth servers and is valuable to understand for real-world OAuth implementations.

Where it's used: Enterprise OAuth servers like Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, and Google Cloud support this flow for enterprise SSO scenarios.

RAR - OIDC discovery is not filling in environment ID on compreshensivecredentials.
