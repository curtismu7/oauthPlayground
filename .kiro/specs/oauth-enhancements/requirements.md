# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature spec addresses the remaining OAuth 2.0 enhancements needed to complete the OAuth Playground project. Based on the comprehensive compliance analysis already completed, we need to fix the tokenDisplay service usage in the Device Authorization flow and implement a fully compliant OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow. These enhancements will ensure all OAuth flows in the playground are properly integrated with the unified token display system and provide complete coverage of OAuth 2.0 specification flows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Device Authorization Flow Token Display Integration

**User Story:** As a developer testing Device Authorization flows, I want the token display to work correctly so that I can view and analyze the tokens returned by the authorization server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Device Authorization flow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display tokens using the standardized tokenDisplay service
2. WHEN tokens are received in the Device Authorization flow THEN the system SHALL format and present them consistently with other flows
3. WHEN the Device Authorization flow encounters token display errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback display options
4. IF the tokenDisplay service is unavailable THEN the Device Authorization flow SHALL gracefully degrade to basic token presentation
5. WHEN users interact with displayed tokens in Device Authorization THEN the system SHALL provide the same copy, validation, and analysis features as other flows

### Requirement 2: Implement OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow

**User Story:** As a developer learning OAuth 2.0, I want access to a compliant Implicit Flow implementation so that I can understand this flow type and test applications that use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users select the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow THEN the system SHALL provide a complete implementation following RFC 6749 Section 4.2
2. WHEN configuring the Implicit Flow THEN the system SHALL validate that response_type is set to "token"
3. WHEN the Implicit Flow authorization request is made THEN the system SHALL include all required parameters (response_type, client_id, redirect_uri, scope, state)
4. WHEN the authorization server responds THEN the system SHALL extract the access token from the URL fragment
5. WHEN tokens are received via URL fragment THEN the system SHALL parse and display them using the standardized tokenDisplay service
6. IF the authorization response contains an error THEN the system SHALL display the error details clearly to the user
7. WHEN the Implicit Flow is used THEN the system SHALL provide educational content explaining the security considerations and appropriate use cases
8. WHEN users complete the Implicit Flow THEN the system SHALL provide token analysis and validation features consistent with other flows

### Requirement 3: Maintain Consistency with Existing Compliance Framework

**User Story:** As a developer using the OAuth Playground, I want all flows to have consistent behavior and presentation so that I can easily compare and understand different OAuth patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Implicit Flow THEN the system SHALL use the same UI patterns and components as other OAuth flows
2. WHEN displaying tokens in any flow THEN the system SHALL use the unified tokenDisplay service for consistent presentation
3. WHEN handling errors in enhanced flows THEN the system SHALL follow the same error handling patterns as existing compliant flows
4. WHEN users navigate between flows THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent state management and credential handling
5. WHEN educational content is displayed THEN the system SHALL follow the same styling and information architecture as existing flows

### Requirement 4: Security and Best Practices Compliance

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want all OAuth implementations to follow security best practices so that I can learn proper implementation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Implicit Flow THEN the system SHALL include warnings about security considerations and deprecation status
2. WHEN handling tokens in any flow THEN the system SHALL implement secure storage and transmission practices
3. WHEN validating parameters THEN the system SHALL perform proper input validation and sanitization
4. WHEN displaying sensitive information THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate masking and reveal controls
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
