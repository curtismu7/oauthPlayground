# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds DPoP (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession) support to OAuth Playground flows as mock/educational implementations only. Since PingOne does not support DPoP, these implementations will be purely educational to demonstrate the DPoP specification (RFC 9449) concepts, security benefits, and implementation patterns without affecting real OAuth flows.

The mock DPoP implementation will help developers understand how DPoP works, its security benefits, and proper implementation patterns while clearly indicating that these are educational demonstrations rather than production-ready integrations.

## Requirements

4. WHEN displaying DPoP proofs THEN the system SHALL clearly label them as "Mock/Educational Only"
5. WHEN generating mock key pairs THEN the system SHALL use browser-compatible crypto APIs for demonstration

### Requirement 3: Client Credentials Flow with Mock DPoP

**User Story:** As a backend developer implementing machine-to-machine authentication, I want to see how DPoP enhances Client Credentials flow security, so that I can understand server-to-server DPoP patterns.

### Requirement 4: Refresh Token Flow with Mock DPoP

**User Story:** As a developer managing token lifecycle, I want to understand how DPoP works with refresh tokens, so that I can implement secure token refresh patterns.

5. IF refresh fails THEN the system SHALL show DPoP-related error scenarios and handling
6. WHEN explaining refresh security THEN the system SHALL compare DPoP vs bearer token refresh patterns

### Requirement 5: Educational Content and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer new to DPoP, I want comprehensive educational content about DPoP concepts, so that I can understand when and how to implement DPoP in real applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing DPoP flows THEN the system SHALL display clear "Mock Implementation" warnings
2. WHEN explaining DPoP THEN the system SHALL provide links to RFC 9449 specification
3. WHEN showing DPoP benefits THEN the system SHALL explain protection against token replay attacks
4. WHEN displaying implementation THEN the system SHALL explain why PingOne doesn't support DPoP
5. WHEN providing examples THEN the system SHALL show real-world DPoP implementation patterns
6. IF users ask about production use THEN the system SHALL guide them to DPoP-supporting authorization servers

### Requirement 6: Clear Mock Implementation Indicators

**User Story:** As a developer using OAuth Playground, I want to clearly understand which features are mock implementations, so that I don't attempt to use mock patterns in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DPoP features are displayed THEN the system SHALL show prominent "Educational Mock Only" badges
2. WHEN generating DPoP proofs THEN the system SHALL include mock signatures with clear labeling
3. WHEN explaining flows THEN the system SHALL distinguish between real PingOne features and mock demonstrations
4. WHEN providing code examples THEN the system SHALL comment mock vs production implementation differences
5. IF users copy code THEN the system SHALL include warnings about mock implementation status
6. WHEN showing flow diagrams THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish mock DPoP steps

### Requirement 7: DPoP Security Education

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to understand DPoP security benefits and implementation considerations, so that I can make informed decisions about OAuth security patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN explaining DPoP THEN the system SHALL demonstrate protection against token theft scenarios
2. WHEN showing key management THEN the system SHALL explain DPoP key lifecycle and rotation
3. WHEN displaying proofs THEN the system SHALL explain jti (JWT ID) uniqueness requirements
4. WHEN demonstrating attacks THEN the system SHALL show how DPoP prevents token replay attacks
5. IF comparing security models THEN the system SHALL contrast DPoP vs bearer token security
6. WHEN providing guidance THEN the system SHALL explain DPoP implementation complexity trade-offs

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Flow Architecture

**User Story:** As a maintainer of OAuth Playground, I want DPoP mock features to integrate cleanly with existing flow architecture, so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding DPoP features THEN the system SHALL use existing V5/V6 service architecture patterns
