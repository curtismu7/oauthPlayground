# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical authentication flow issues in the PingOne OAuth Playground that are preventing proper testing and demonstration of advanced authentication scenarios. The issues span Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), redirect handling, PingOne MFA QR code generation, email delivery automation, and activation flows. These fixes are essential for providing a complete and functional authentication testing environment.

## Requirements

5. WHEN receiving authorization responses THEN the system SHALL display any returned authorization_details in the token response
6. IF authorization_details are malformed THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation errors before making requests
7. WHEN displaying RAR examples THEN the system SHALL show sample authorization_details like customer_information with read/write actions

### Requirement 2: Proper Redirect Flow Handling

**User Story:** As a developer testing OAuth flows, I want redirects to maintain flow context so that I can complete the full authentication cycle without being redirected to unrelated pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PingOne redirects back to the application THEN the system SHALL remain within the current flow context
2. WHEN authorization completes THEN the system SHALL return to the originating flow page rather than the dashboard
3. WHEN handling redirect URIs THEN the system SHALL preserve flow state and continue from the appropriate step
4. WHEN errors occur during redirects THEN the system SHALL display errors within the flow context
5. WHEN multiple flows are active THEN the system SHALL route redirects to the correct flow instance
6. IF redirect state is lost THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options to resume the flow

### Requirement 3: PingOne MFA QR Code Display

**User Story:** As a developer testing MFA flows, I want QR codes to be automatically generated and displayed so that I can test mobile authenticator app enrollment without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MFA enrollment is initiated THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and display QR codes
2. WHEN QR codes are displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper TOTP/HOTP parameters for authenticator apps
3. WHEN users scan QR codes THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for completing enrollment
4. WHEN QR code generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative enrollment methods (manual entry)
5. WHEN displaying QR codes THEN the system SHALL include backup codes or alternative recovery options
6. IF QR codes are not supported THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to manual secret entry

### Requirement 4: Automated MFA Email Delivery

**User Story:** As a developer testing email-based MFA, I want the system to automatically send verification codes so that I can test complete email MFA flows without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email MFA is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically send verification codes to the specified email
2. WHEN codes are sent THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation that the email was delivered
3. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
4. WHEN testing email flows THEN the system SHALL support both real and test email addresses
5. WHEN codes expire THEN the system SHALL allow users to request new codes automatically
6. IF email service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative verification methods

### Requirement 5: MFA Activation Email Automation

**User Story:** As a developer testing MFA activation flows, I want activation emails to be sent automatically so that I can test complete MFA setup workflows without manual email triggers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MFA activation is initiated THEN the system SHALL automatically send activation emails
2. WHEN activation emails are sent THEN the system SHALL include proper activation links and instructions
3. WHEN users click activation links THEN the system SHALL complete the MFA setup process
4. WHEN activation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN activation succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm successful MFA setup to the user
6. IF activation emails are not delivered THEN the system SHALL provide alternative activation methods

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Flow State Management

**User Story:** As a developer testing complex authentication flows, I want reliable flow state management so that I can test multi-step authentication scenarios without losing progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN flows involve multiple steps THEN the system SHALL maintain state throughout the entire process
2. WHEN external redirects occur THEN the system SHALL preserve flow context and return to the correct step
3. WHEN errors interrupt flows THEN the system SHALL allow users to resume from the last successful step
4. WHEN multiple authentication methods are used THEN the system SHALL coordinate state between different auth mechanisms
5. WHEN flows timeout THEN the system SHALL provide clear timeout messages and restart options
6. IF state corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and recover gracefully

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer debugging authentication issues, I want detailed error information and recovery options so that I can understand and resolve authentication problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error descriptions with suggested resolutions
2. WHEN network issues interrupt flows THEN the system SHALL detect and provide retry mechanisms
3. WHEN configuration errors are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight specific configuration problems
4. WHEN PingOne service errors occur THEN the system SHALL display service-specific error details
5. WHEN recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL provide clear steps to resume or restart flows
6. IF errors are unrecoverable THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on alternative approaches

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation Tools

**User Story:** As a developer validating authentication implementations, I want built-in testing tools so that I can verify that authentication flows work correctly before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing RAR flows THEN the system SHALL validate authorization_details structure and content
2. WHEN testing MFA flows THEN the system SHALL provide test accounts and verification methods
3. WHEN testing email flows THEN the system SHALL support test email addresses with visible delivery confirmation
4. WHEN testing redirect flows THEN the system SHALL validate redirect URI configuration and handling
5. WHEN flows complete THEN the system SHALL provide validation reports showing successful authentication steps
6. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reports on what needs to be fixed

### Requirement 9: Educational Content and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer learning advanced authentication patterns, I want comprehensive documentation and examples so that I can understand proper implementation of RAR, MFA, and redirect handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing RAR flows THEN the system SHALL provide examples of authorization_details for different use cases
2. WHEN setting up MFA THEN the system SHALL explain different MFA methods and their security implications
3. WHEN configuring redirects THEN the system SHALL document proper redirect URI patterns and security considerations
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide common issue resolution guides
5. WHEN implementing flows THEN the system SHALL provide code examples for different programming languages
6. IF users need additional help THEN the system SHALL link to relevant OAuth and PingOne documentation

### Requirement 10: Integration with Existing Architecture

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the OAuth Playground, I want authentication fixes to integrate seamlessly with existing code so that the system remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing fixes THEN the system SHALL use existing service architecture patterns (V5/V6 services)
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL follow established UI component and styling patterns
3. WHEN modifying flows THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing flow configurations
4. WHEN handling state THEN the system SHALL use existing state management services and patterns
5. WHEN adding error handling THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing error display and logging systems
6. IF architectural changes are needed THEN the system SHALL minimize impact on existing working flows
