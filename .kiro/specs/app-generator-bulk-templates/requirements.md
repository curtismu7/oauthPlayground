# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing PingOne Application Generator by adding advanced configuration presets for common use cases, application management capabilities (update/delete), and export/import functionality. Users will be able to use predefined configuration presets, manage existing applications, and share configurations between environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a PingOne administrator, I want to use advanced configuration presets for common use cases, so that I can quickly apply industry-standard configurations without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application generator THEN the system SHALL display predefined configuration presets for common scenarios
2. WHEN I select a configuration preset THEN the system SHALL populate all relevant fields with preset values
3. WHEN I use a preset THEN the system SHALL apply security best practices and compliance settings automatically
4. WHEN presets are applied THEN the system SHALL allow customization of preset values before creation
5. WHEN I create an application from a preset THEN the system SHALL indicate which preset was used in the application metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export and import application configurations, so that I can share setups between environments and backup configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure an application THEN the system SHALL provide an option to export the configuration as JSON
2. WHEN I export a configuration THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable JSON file with all settings
3. WHEN I import a configuration file THEN the system SHALL validate the JSON format and populate the form
4. WHEN import validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages about invalid fields
5. WHEN import succeeds THEN the system SHALL populate all form fields and indicate successful import

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a PingOne administrator, I want to manage existing applications through the generator, so that I can update and delete applications without using the PingOne console.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have a worker token THEN the system SHALL provide an option to load existing applications from the environment
2. WHEN I select "Manage Existing Applications" THEN the system SHALL fetch and display a list of applications in the environment
3. WHEN I select an existing application THEN the system SHALL populate the form with the current configuration
4. WHEN I modify an existing application configuration THEN the system SHALL provide an "Update Application" button
5. WHEN I update an application THEN the system SHALL call the PingOne API to update the application settings
6. WHEN I choose to delete an application THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before deletion
7. WHEN deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL call the PingOne API to delete the application
8. WHEN update or delete operations fail THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
9. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL display confirmation and refresh the application list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to save and load custom configuration templates, so that I can reuse common application setups across projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure an application THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save the configuration as a custom template
2. WHEN I save a template THEN the system SHALL prompt for template name and description
3. WHEN I save a template THEN the system SHALL store the template in local storage with all configuration parameters
4. WHEN I access saved templates THEN the system SHALL display a list of custom templates with metadata
5. WHEN I select a saved template THEN the system SHALL populate the form with the template configuration
6. WHEN I manage templates THEN the system SHALL allow editing template names/descriptions and deleting templates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enhanced validation and error handling, so that I can identify configuration issues before application creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter configuration values THEN the system SHALL validate fields in real-time with clear error indicators
2. WHEN validation errors exist THEN the system SHALL prevent application creation and highlight problematic fields
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display detailed error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and connection troubleshooting
5. WHEN configurations are valid THEN the system SHALL display confirmation indicators and enable creation
