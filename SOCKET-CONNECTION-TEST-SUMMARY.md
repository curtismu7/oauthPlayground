# Socket Connection Test on Startup - v5.4

## Feature Description

Added automatic socket connection testing that runs every time the server starts up to ensure real-time communication systems are working properly.

## Implementation

### Socket Connection Test Function

**File**: `server.js`

**Added comprehensive socket testing**:
- **Socket.IO Test**: Tests the primary Socket.IO connection
- **WebSocket Test**: Tests the fallback WebSocket connection
- **Timeout Handling**: 5-second timeout for each test
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs results to both console and logger

### Test Features

1. **Socket.IO Connection Test**
   ```javascript
   const testSocket = io.sockets.connect(`http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`, {
       timeout: 3000,
       forceNew: true
   });
   ```

2. **WebSocket Connection Test**
   ```javascript
   const WebSocket = (await import('ws')).WebSocket;
   const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`);
   ```

3. **Parallel Testing**
   ```javascript
   const [socketIoResult, webSocketResult] = await Promise.allSettled([
       socketIoTest,
       webSocketTest
   ]);
   ```

### Console Output

The tests provide clear visual feedback:

- ‚úÖ **Socket.IO connection test: PASSED**
- ‚úÖ **WebSocket connection test: PASSED**
- üéâ **All real-time communication systems are working!**

Or if there are issues:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Socket.IO connection test: FAILED**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WebSocket connection test: FAILED**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Some real-time communication systems may have issues**

### Logging

All test results are logged with detailed information:

```javascript
logger.info('Socket.IO test passed', { result: socketIoResult.value });
logger.warn('Socket.IO test failed', { error: socketIoResult.reason.message });
logger.info('All socket connection tests passed');
logger.warn('Some socket connection tests failed', {
    socketIo: socketIoResult.status,
    webSocket: webSocketResult.status
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Detects socket issues immediately on startup
2. **Clear Feedback**: Provides visual and logged feedback about socket status
3. **Non-Blocking**: Tests run asynchronously and don't prevent server startup
4. **Comprehensive**: Tests both Socket.IO and WebSocket connections
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of test failures
6. **Timeout Protection**: Prevents tests from hanging indefinitely

## Test Execution

- **Timing**: Tests run 1 second after server startup
- **Duration**: Each test has a 5-second timeout
- **Scope**: Tests both primary (Socket.IO) and fallback (WebSocket) systems
- **Non-Intrusive**: Tests don't interfere with normal server operation

## Impact

This feature ensures that administrators and developers can immediately see if the real-time communication systems are working properly when the server starts up. This helps prevent issues where users might experience problems with real-time progress updates during imports without knowing there's a socket connection problem.

The tests provide early warning of potential issues and help maintain the reliability of the real-time communication features that are critical for the import process.
