- ✨ OIDC Discovery (paste URL → auto-populate)
- ✨ Auto-Save (saves on every change)
- ✨ Cross-Flow Persistence (configure once, use everywhere)

### ✅ Plus Full V6 Upgrade:
- Files renamed: V5 → V6
- Routes updated: `/flows/*-v5` → `/flows/*-v6`
- Menu entries show V6 badges
- 22 files updated
- -330 lines of code eliminated

### ✅ All V6 Services Integrated:
- ComprehensiveCredentialsService
- EducationalContentService
- UISettingsService
- FlowCompletionService (OIDC)
- UnifiedTokenDisplayService (OIDC)
- Plus 6+ supporting services
