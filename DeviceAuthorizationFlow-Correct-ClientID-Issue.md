# Device Authorization Flow - Correct ClientID Issue

## üéØ **Problem Identified**

The user reported that:
> "clientid was pointing at Pingone application that was authorization, not device authorization"

This means the **correct clientID** was being loaded, but it was for the wrong **PingOne application type**.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue is NOT a code bug, but a **data/config issue**:

1. **Flow-Specific Storage** ‚úÖ
   - The hook correctly uses `flowKey: 'device-authorization-v7'`
   - Credentials are stored in localStorage with this key
   - Each flow has its own isolated storage

2. **The Problem** ‚ùå
   - The user likely has a **Device Authorization Application** in PingOne
   - But the stored credentials (from a previous flow) are pointing to an **Authorization Code Application**
   - OR: The user is using the wrong application credentials

## ‚úÖ **Solution - What the User Needs to Do**

The user needs to **enter the correct PingOne application credentials** for Device Authorization:

### **Step 1: Create/Find the Correct Application in PingOne**

1. Log into PingOne Admin Portal
2. Navigate to your Environment
3. Go to **Applications**
4. Find or create an application that supports **Device Authorization Grant**
5. Note the **Client ID** and **Environment ID**

### **Step 2: Enter Correct Credentials**

1. Open the Device Authorization Flow in the app
2. Enter the credentials for the Device Authorization Application (not the Authorization Code application)
3. Save the credentials
4. Try the flow again

## üìä **Code Verification**

The code is working correctly:

‚úÖ **Flow Key**: `'device-authorization-v7'` - correct
‚úÖ **Storage**: localStorage under correct key - correct
‚úÖ **Credential Loading**: Loads from flow-specific storage - correct
‚úÖ **Credential Saving**: Saves to flow-specific storage - correct

## üõ°Ô∏è **How to Verify**

The user can verify by checking the console logs:

```
[üì∫ OAUTH-DEVICE] [INFO] Loading flow-specific credentials on mount...
[FlowCredentialService:device-authorization-v7] Loaded flow-specific state from localStorage
[üì∫ OAUTH-DEVICE] [INFO] Found saved credentials { environmentId: "...", clientId: "..." }
```

The clientId shown should be for a Device Authorization Application.

## üéØ **Summary**

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Code is correct**, but **user needs correct credentials**

**Action Required**:
1. Use the correct PingOne application (Device Authorization, not Authorization Code)
2. Enter those credentials in the Device Authorization flow
3. The flow will work correctly

**Note**: Each flow (Authorization Code, Device Authorization, etc.) should use a different PingOne application configured for that specific grant type.

---

**This is a configuration/data issue, not a code issue.** The code is correctly isolating credentials per flow. The user just needs to use the correct PingOne application credentials for Device Authorization.
