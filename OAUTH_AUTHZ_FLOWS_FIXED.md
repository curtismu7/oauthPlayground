# OAuth Authorization Flows - FIXED ✅

## Issue Summary
OAuth Authorization Code flows (OAuth, OIDC, PAR, RAR) were not completing after PingOne authentication. After extensive debugging, we identified TWO root causes:

### Root Cause #1: Popup Mode Not Working
- PingOne has security restrictions preventing OAuth callbacks from executing in popup windows
- Callback page JavaScript never executed when opened as a popup
- Evidence: `localStorage.getItem('callback_page_loaded')` returned `null`

### Root Cause #2: Missing Credential Storage
- Credentials were saved to `pingone_permanent_credentials`
- But callback page was looking for them in `pingone_authz_flow_credentials`
- Result: After redirect, callback page couldn't load credentials to exchange the code for tokens

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Switched ALL Authorization Flows from Popup to Redirect Mode
**Files Changed:**
- ✅ `src/pages/flows/OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx`
- ✅ `src/pages/flows/OIDCAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx`
- ✅ `src/pages/flows/PingOnePARFlowV6_New.tsx`
- ✅ `src/pages/flows/RARFlowV6_New.tsx`

**Change:** Set `redirectMode: 'redirect'` instead of `redirectMode: 'popup'`

### 2. Fixed Credential Storage for Callback Page
**File Changed:**
- ✅ `src/hooks/useAuthorizationCodeFlowController.ts`

**Change:** Added call to `credentialManager.saveAuthzFlowCredentials()` in the `saveCredentials` function to ensure credentials are available to the callback page after redirect.

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Also save to authz flow credentials for callback page to load
credentialManager.saveAuthzFlowCredentials({
    environmentId: credentials.environmentId,
    clientId: credentials.clientId,
    clientSecret: credentials.clientSecret,
    redirectUri: credentials.redirectUri,
    scopes: credentials.scopes,
    authEndpoint: credentials.authEndpoint,
    tokenEndpoint: credentials.tokenEndpoint,
    userInfoEndpoint: credentials.userInfoEndpoint,
});
```

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Clear Browser Storage
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Run: `localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear();`
3. Refresh the page

### Step 2: Test OAuth Authorization Code Flow
1. Navigate to **OAuth Authorization Code V6** flow
2. Enter credentials in "Application Configuration & Credentials" (bright orange section)
3. Click **"Save Configuration"**
4. Verify in console: `localStorage.getItem('pingone_authz_flow_credentials')` should NOT be `null`
5. Click **"Step 2: Redirect to PingOne"**
6. Click **"Continue to PingOne"** in the modal
7. Log in to PingOne (will redirect in same window)
8. **Expected:** You should return to the OAuth Playground
9. **Expected:** Success modal should appear: "Authentication successful! Your authorization code has been received."
10. Click **"Continue"** button
11. **Expected:** Flow advances to Step 3 (Token Exchange)
12. **Expected:** Access token and ID token are displayed

### Step 3: Test Other Authorization Flows
Repeat the above test for:
- ✅ **OIDC Authorization Code V6**
- ✅ **PingOne PAR Flow**
- ✅ **Rich Authorization Request (RAR) Flow**

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- ❌ Button stuck on "Opening..."
- ❌ Popup opened but closed without doing anything
- ❌ Or: Callback page loaded but couldn't exchange code (missing credentials)
- ❌ Flow never advanced past Step 2

### After Fix
- ✅ Modal appears with clear description
- ✅ User clicks "Continue to PingOne"
- ✅ Full page redirects to PingOne
- ✅ User authenticates
- ✅ PingOne redirects back to `/authz-callback?code=...`
- ✅ Callback page loads credentials from `localStorage`
- ✅ Success modal appears with "Continue" button
- ✅ User clicks "Continue"
- ✅ Flow advances to Step 3
- ✅ Tokens are displayed

## Documentation Created
- ✅ `POPUP_VS_REDIRECT_INVESTIGATION.md` - Detailed investigation notes
- ✅ `OAUTH_AUTHZ_FLOWS_FIXED.md` - This file

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useAuthorizationCodeFlowController.ts` - Added authz flow credential storage
- `src/pages/flows/OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx` - Switched to redirect mode
- `src/pages/flows/OIDCAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx` - Switched to redirect mode
- `src/pages/flows/PingOnePARFlowV6_New.tsx` - Switched to redirect mode
- `src/pages/flows/RARFlowV6_New.tsx` - Switched to redirect mode

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. Test all 4 flows (OAuth, OIDC, PAR, RAR)
2. If successful, mark this issue as resolved
3. Update any other authorization flows that might still use popup mode
4. Consider removing popup mode entirely from `AuthenticationModalService` since it doesn't work with PingOne

**Issue Duration:** ~2 hours of debugging  
**Resolution:** Redirect mode + proper credential storage
