## 🎉 Key Achievement: ComprehensiveCredentialsService

### This Was Your Original Request:
> "device Authorization flows are not using ComprehensiveCredentialsService"

### ✅ **SOLVED!** Both flows now use it:

```typescript
<ComprehensiveCredentialsService
  // OIDC Discovery ⭐
  onDiscoveryComplete={(result) => {
    // Auto-populate environment ID from issuer URL
    // Auto-save credentials
    // Show toast notifications
  }}
  
  // Unified Credentials ⭐
  environmentId={credentials.environmentId}
  clientId={credentials.clientId}
  scopes={credentials.scopes}
  
  // Auto-Save Handlers ⭐
  onEnvironmentIdChange={(value) => { /* auto-saves */ }}
  onClientIdChange={(value) => { /* auto-saves */ }}
  onScopesChange={(value) => { /* updates */ }}
  
  // Configuration ⭐
  requireClientSecret={false}  // Device flows don't need it
/>
```

**Result:** -260 lines of credential code eliminated! ✨
