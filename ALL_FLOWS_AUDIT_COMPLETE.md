## 💡 Root Cause Analysis

### Why These Issues Occurred:

1. **Orphaned Tags:**
   - Nested collapsible sections inside conditionals
   - Empty placeholder sections from partial migrations
   - Script's regex couldn't handle deeply nested structures

2. **Unused Styled Components:**
   - Script successfully removed component usage but missed some definitions
   - Definitions were separated from their usage by many lines
   - Some files had duplicate definitions that were partially removed

### Lessons Learned:
- ✅ Always run build after automated migrations
- ✅ Check for both JSX usage and styled component definitions
- ✅ Look for patterns like `/* content */` placeholders
- ✅ Manual review catches edge cases scripts miss
