QUICK ACCESS SECTION - What Should Be Visible:

1. Dashboard (🏠) - Active (blue background)
2. Settings (⚙️) - Normal
3. OAuth 2.1 (🔐) - Normal (now highlighted with yellow background for visibility)
4. AI Overview (🤖) - Normal

Current HTML Structure:
- All 4 items are present in the HTML
- CSS styling is correct
- No display: none or visibility: hidden

If OAuth 2.1 is not visible, possible issues:
1. Browser cache needs refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. CSS conflict
3. JavaScript error preventing rendering

The OAuth 2.1 item should appear between Settings and AI Overview in the Quick Access section.
