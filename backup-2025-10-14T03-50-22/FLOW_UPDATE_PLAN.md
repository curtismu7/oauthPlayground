# Flow Update Plan: Response Mode Service & Colored URL Display

## ‚úÖ Completed Flows
- [x] OIDC Hybrid Flow V5 - Full implementation with response mode + colored URL
- [x] OAuth Authorization Code Flow V5 - Colored URL display
- [x] OIDC Authorization Code Flow V5 - Colored URL display  
- [x] Redirectless Flow V5 - Colored URL display

## üîÑ Flows Needing Response Mode Service
These flows should have response mode selection (they involve user redirects):

### High Priority (User-facing redirects)
- [ ] OAuth Implicit Flow V5
- [ ] OIDC Implicit Flow V5
- [ ] OIDC Authorization Code Flow V5 (already has ResponseModeSelector, needs integration)
- [ ] OAuth Authorization Code Flow V5 (needs ResponseModeSelector)

### Medium Priority (Mock flows with redirects)
- [ ] Redirectless Flow V5 Mock
- [ ] PAR (Pushed Authorization Request) V5
- [ ] RAR (Rich Authorization Requests) V5

## üîÑ Flows Needing Colored URL Display
These flows generate authorization URLs that should use ColoredUrlDisplay:

### High Priority (Active flows)
- [ ] OAuth Implicit Flow V5
- [ ] OIDC Implicit Flow V5
- [ ] PAR (Pushed Authorization Request) V5
- [ ] RAR (Rich Authorization Requests) V5

### Medium Priority (Mock flows)
- [ ] Redirectless Flow V5 Mock
- [ ] All other mock flows that generate URLs

## üö´ Flows That DON'T Need Response Mode
These flows don't involve user redirects, so no response mode needed:
- [ ] Client Credentials Flow V5
- [ ] Device Authorization Flow V5
- [ ] Resource Owner Password Flow V5
- [ ] JWT Bearer Token Flow V5
- [ ] CIBA Flow V5

## üìù Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Response Mode to OAuth/OIDC Implicit Flows
1. Add ResponseModeSelector component
2. Add response mode state management
3. Update URL generation to include response_mode parameter
4. Add ColoredUrlDisplay for URL display

### Step 2: Add Response Mode to Authorization Code Flows
1. OAuth Authorization Code Flow V5: Add ResponseModeSelector
2. OIDC Authorization Code Flow V5: Ensure response mode integration works
3. Update URL generation in both flows

### Step 3: Add Colored URL Display to Remaining Flows
1. PAR (Pushed Authorization Request) V5
2. RAR (Rich Authorization Requests) V5
3. Redirectless Flow V5 Mock
4. Any other flows that generate authorization URLs

### Step 4: Testing & Validation
1. Test each flow to ensure response_mode appears in URLs
2. Test colored URL display works correctly
3. Test parameter explanation popup
4. Verify response mode selection updates URLs properly

## üéØ Expected Results
- All flows with user redirects will have response mode selection
- All flows with authorization URLs will have colored, interactive URL display
- Users can understand URL parameters through the explanation popup
- Consistent experience across all flows
