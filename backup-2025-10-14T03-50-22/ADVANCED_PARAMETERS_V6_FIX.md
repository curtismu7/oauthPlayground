## 🐛 **Error Details**

**Error Message:**
```
AdvancedParametersV6.tsx:223 Uncaught TypeError: EducationalContentService.getEducationalSection is not a function
```

**Root Cause:**
- `EducationalContentService` is exported as a React component, not as a service with static methods
- The code was trying to call `EducationalContentService.getEducationalSection()` as if it were a static method
- This caused a runtime error when the AdvancedParametersV6 page was accessed

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **1. Fixed Import Statement**
**Before:**
```tsx
import { EducationalContentService } from '../../services/educationalContentService';
```

**After:**
```tsx
import EducationalContentService from '../../services/educationalContentService';
```

### **2. Fixed Component Usage**
**Before:**
```tsx
{EducationalContentService.getEducationalSection({
  flowType: actualFlowType,
  section: 'overview',
  collapsed: collapsedSections.education,
  onToggleCollapsed: () => toggleCollapsed('education')
})}
```

```tsx
<EducationalContentService 
  flowType={actualFlowType}

/>
```

## 🔍 **Analysis**

### **How Other Flows Use EducationalContentService:**
Looking at `PingOnePARFlowV6_New.tsx`, the correct usage is:
```tsx
<EducationalContentService flowType="par" defaultCollapsed={false} />
```

### **Service Architecture:**
- `EducationalContentService` is a React component that takes props
- It's not a service class with static methods
- The component handles its own collapsible state internally
