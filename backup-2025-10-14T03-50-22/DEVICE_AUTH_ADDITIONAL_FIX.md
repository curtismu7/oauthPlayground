# Device Authorization Additional Fix

## Problem
User reported: "still can not edit credentials on Device auth under Oauth"

Even after adding debouncing to the `setCredentials` function, the input fields were still not editable.

## Root Cause #2: Toast Messages on Every Keystroke!

While we fixed the localStorage save issue with debouncing, the code was STILL showing toast messages on every keystroke:

```typescript
onEnvironmentIdChange={(newEnvId) => {
    deviceFlow.setCredentials({
        ...deviceFlow.credentials,
        environmentId: newEnvId,
    });
    // This was showing a toast on EVERY keystroke!
    if (newEnvId && deviceFlow.credentials?.clientId && newEnvId.trim() && deviceFlow.credentials.clientId.trim()) {
        v4ToastManager.showSuccess('Credentials auto-saved'); // ❌ BAD
    }
}}
```

**The toast system causes React re-renders**, which was still overwriting the input value before the next keystroke!

## Solution

### 1. Removed All Toast Messages from onChange Handlers

**File**: `DeviceAuthorizationFlowV6.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE ❌
onEnvironmentIdChange={(newEnvId) => {
    deviceFlow.setCredentials({
        ...deviceFlow.credentials,
        environmentId: newEnvId,
    });
    if (newEnvId && deviceFlow.credentials?.clientId && newEnvId.trim() && deviceFlow.credentials.clientId.trim()) {
        v4ToastManager.showSuccess('Credentials auto-saved'); // ❌ Causes re-render!
    }
}}

// AFTER ✅
onEnvironmentIdChange={(newEnvId) => {
    deviceFlow.setCredentials({
        ...deviceFlow.credentials,
        environmentId: newEnvId,
    });
    // setCredentials already saves to localStorage automatically (debounced)
}}
```

### 2. Disabled Provider Info Display

The provider info panel was also potentially causing re-renders on discovery, so disabled it:

```typescript
showProviderInfo={false}  // Changed from true
```

### 3. Fixed Scopes Sync

Ensured both `scope` and `scopes` fields stay in sync:

```typescript
onScopesChange={(newScopes) => {
    deviceFlow.setCredentials({
        ...deviceFlow.credentials,
        scopes: newScopes,
        scope: newScopes, // Keep both in sync
    });
}}
```

## Changes Made

**File**: `/Users/cmuir/P1Import-apps/oauth-playground/src/pages/flows/DeviceAuthorizationFlowV6.tsx`

1. Lines ~1280-1286: Removed toast from `onEnvironmentIdChange`
2. Lines ~1287-1293: Removed toast from `onClientIdChange`
3. Lines ~1300-1307: Added scope sync in `onScopesChange`
4. Line ~1270: Disabled `showProviderInfo`

## Why This Fixes It

Now the input flow is:
1. ✅ User types a character
2. ✅ `onEnvironmentIdChange` fires
3. ✅ `deviceFlow.setCredentials` updates state immediately
4. ✅ localStorage save is debounced (500ms)
5. ✅ **NO toast message** (no re-render)
6. ✅ **NO provider info update** (no re-render)
7. ✅ User can type next character immediately

## Complete Fix Summary

### Issue #1: Excessive localStorage Saves
- **Fixed in**: `useDeviceAuthorizationFlow.ts`
- **Solution**: Added 500ms debouncing

### Issue #2: Toast Messages on Every Keystroke  
- **Fixed in**: `DeviceAuthorizationFlowV6.tsx`
- **Solution**: Removed all toast messages from onChange handlers

## Flows Fixed

1. ✅ **Device Authorization Flow V6 (OAuth)** - `DeviceAuthorizationFlowV6.tsx`
2. ✅ **Device Authorization Flow V6 (OIDC)** - `OIDCDeviceAuthorizationFlowV6.tsx`

Both flows now have:
- No toast messages during typing
- Debounced localStorage saves (500ms)
- Disabled provider info updates
- Proper scope/scopes synchronization

## Testing

1. Navigate to **Device Authorization Flow V6 (OAuth or OIDC)**
2. Click in **Environment ID** field
3. Type a new environment ID
4. ✅ Characters should appear normally as you type
5. ✅ No toasts should appear while typing
6. ✅ No console spam about credentials being saved
7. ✅ After 500ms of no typing, one save occurs
8. Refresh page
9. ✅ Credentials should be saved with scopes included

## Performance Impact

- **Before**: Toast on every keystroke + localStorage save
- **After**: No toasts during typing, localStorage saves once after typing stops
- **Result**: Smooth, responsive input experience
