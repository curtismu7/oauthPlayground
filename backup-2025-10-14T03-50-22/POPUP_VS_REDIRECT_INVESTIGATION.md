# Popup vs Redirect Mode Investigation

## Summary
After extensive debugging, we determined that **popup mode does not work with PingOne** for OAuth authorization flows in this application, but **redirect mode works correctly**.

## Timeline
- **Issue**: OAuth Authorization Code flow was not completing after PingOne authentication
- **Duration**: ~2 hours of debugging
- **Resolution**: Switch from popup mode to redirect mode

## Key Findings

### ✅ What Works: Redirect Mode
- PingOne successfully redirects to `https://localhost:3000/authz-callback?code=...`
- Authorization code is properly returned
- URL parameters are correct
- State parameter is validated

### ❌ What Doesn't Work: Popup Mode
- Popup opens successfully
- PingOne login page loads
- User can authenticate
- **BUT**: Callback page JavaScript never executes in the popup
- `localStorage.getItem('callback_page_loaded')` returns `null`
- No debug information is ever saved

## Root Cause
PingOne appears to have security restrictions that prevent the OAuth callback from working in popup windows. This is a common security feature with identity providers that either:
1. Break out of popup contexts
2. Block redirects in popups
3. Prevent cross-origin operations in popups

## Evidence
1. **Redirect Mode Test**: Successfully received authorization code
2. **Popup Mode Test**: Callback page JavaScript never executed (`callback_page_loaded` flag was `null`)
3. **Console Logs**: Show popup opening and closing, but no callback execution

## Solution
**Use redirect mode for all authorization flows**. This requires:
1. Setting `redirectMode: 'redirect'` in the authentication modal
2. Ensuring credentials load from localStorage after redirect
3. Properly handling the callback in the main window context

## Configuration Changed
- File: `src/pages/flows/OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx`
- Change: Set `redirectMode` from `'popup'` to `'redirect'`
- Status: ✅ Implemented

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Switch to redirect mode
2. ⏳ Fix credential loading in callback page (if needed)
3. ⏳ Test complete flow end-to-end
4. ⏳ Update other authorization flows (OIDC, PAR, RAR, etc.) to use redirect mode

## Notes
- The authorization URL generation is correct
- PingOne configuration is correct
- Redirect URI configuration is correct (`https://localhost:3000/authz-callback`)
- The issue is specifically with popup execution context
