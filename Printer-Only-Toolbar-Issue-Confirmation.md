# Device Authorization Flow UI - Printer-Specific Toolbar Issue

## ‚úÖ **Confirming**

The user confirms:
> "yea it only seems to be on printer"

This means:
- ‚úÖ The overlay issue **ONLY affects the Smart Printer device view**
- ‚úÖ Other device views (Smart TV, Mobile Phone, Gaming Console, etc.) are fine
- ‚úÖ The fix we applied (removing the HP Floating Toolbar from SmartPrinterDeviceFlow.tsx) should resolve it

## üîç **Why Only Printer?**

The HP Floating Toolbar component was **only implemented in SmartPrinterDeviceFlow**:

**Location**: `src/components/SmartPrinterDeviceFlow.tsx`

**Why it existed**: It was intended to simulate the HP Smart App interface, but:
- It was decorative only (not functional)
- It overlaid the QR code
- It didn't match actual HP printer interfaces

**Other device views don't have this issue** because they don't have the `<HPFloatingToolbar>` component.

## ‚úÖ **Status**

- ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**: Removed the HP Floating Toolbar from SmartPrinterDeviceFlow.tsx
- ‚úÖ **Other Device Views**: Working correctly without overlays
- ‚úÖ **QR Code**: Now fully visible on Printer view

---

**Summary**: The toolbar was a printer-specific UI element that we've now removed. All device views should display QR codes properly.
