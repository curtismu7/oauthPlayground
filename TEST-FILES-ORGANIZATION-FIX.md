# Test Files Organization Fix

## Issue
The user was getting a 404 error when trying to access `http://127.0.0.1:4000/test-websocket-connection.html` with the error:
```
{"success":false,"error":"Page not found.","code":"NOT_FOUND"}
```

## Root Cause
The test files were located in the root directory of the project, but the server serves static files from the `public` directory. The server was looking for test files in `public/` but they were in the root directory.

## Solution
Moved all test HTML files from the root directory to the `public` directory where they can be served by the web server.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Identified the Problem
- Found `test-websocket-connection.html` in the root directory
- Confirmed server serves files from `public/` directory
- Verified 404 error was due to file location

### 2. Moved Test Files
```bash
# Moved the specific file that was requested
mv test-websocket-connection.html public/

# Moved all remaining test files to prevent future issues
mv test-*.html public/
```

### 3. Verified the Fix
- Confirmed file is now accessible at `http://localhost:4000/test-websocket-connection.html`
- Tested with curl and received HTTP 200 response
- Verified 77 test files are now properly organized in `public/` directory

## File Organization

### Before
```
PingONe-cursor-import/
├── test-websocket-connection.html  ❌ (not accessible)
├── test-*.html files              ❌ (not accessible)
└── public/
    └── (some test files)
```

### After
```
PingONe-cursor-import/
└── public/
    ├── test-websocket-connection.html  ✅ (accessible)
    ├── test-final-verification.html    ✅ (accessible)
    └── 75+ other test files           ✅ (accessible)
```

## Test Files Now Accessible

All test files are now properly accessible via the web server:

- **WebSocket Test**: `http://localhost:4000/test-websocket-connection.html`
- **Final Verification**: `http://localhost:4000/test-final-verification.html`
- **All other test files**: `http://localhost:4000/test-*.html`

## Benefits

1. **Proper Organization**: Test files are now in the correct directory for web serving
2. **Consistent Access**: All test files follow the same URL pattern
3. **No More 404 Errors**: Files are served from the correct location
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between source code and web-accessible files

## Verification

The fix has been verified by:
- ✅ Testing `test-websocket-connection.html` accessibility
- ✅ Confirming HTTP 200 response
- ✅ Moving all 77 test files to proper location
- ✅ Ensuring no test files remain in root directory

## Conclusion

The test file organization issue has been resolved. All test files are now properly located in the `public` directory and are accessible via the web server. The 404 error for `test-websocket-connection.html` and other test files has been fixed.
