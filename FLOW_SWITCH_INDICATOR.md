# Flow Switch Visual Indicator

## What Was Added

When users switch between flows in the sidebar, they now get a **quick and subtle** visual confirmation:

### 1. Toast Notification ðŸ””
- **Location**: Top-right corner
- **Duration**: 1.5 seconds (quick!)
- **Message**: "Switched to [Flow Name]"
- **Style**: Info toast with blue color
- **Behavior**: Only shows when switching to a **different** flow (not when clicking the same flow)

### 2. Page Fade-In Animation âœ¨
- **Duration**: 0.3 seconds
- **Effect**: Subtle fade-in with slight upward movement (10px)
- **Trigger**: Every time a new page/flow loads
- **Purpose**: Makes the transition feel smooth and intentional

## Implementation Details

### Sidebar.tsx Changes
- Added `v4ToastManager` import
- Created `getFlowName()` function to map paths to friendly names
- Modified `handleNavigation()` to show toast when switching flows
- Toast only displays if navigating to a **different** page

### App.tsx Changes
- Added `fadeInPage` keyframe animation to `MainContent` styled component
- Animation: opacity 0â†’1, translateY 10pxâ†’0
- Duration: 0.3 seconds with ease-in-out timing

## User Experience

**Before:**
- No indication when switching flows
- Could be unclear if the flow actually changed
- Instant but jarring transitions

**After:**
- âœ… Quick toast confirms the switch ("Switched to OAuth Authorization Code")
- âœ… Smooth fade-in animation makes transition feel polished
- âœ… Subtle but noticeable - doesn't interrupt workflow
- âœ… Total feedback time: ~1.5 seconds before toast auto-dismisses

## Flow Names Mapped

All major flows have friendly names:
- OAuth Authorization Code
- OAuth Implicit Flow
- OIDC Authorization Code
- OIDC Implicit Flow
- OIDC Hybrid Flow
- Client Credentials
- Device Authorization
- Worker Token
- JWT Bearer Token
- SAML Bearer Assertion
- PingOne PAR
- Rich Authorization Request
- Resource Owner Password

## Performance

- **Lightweight**: Just a CSS animation + toast notification
- **Non-blocking**: Doesn't delay navigation
- **Accessible**: Toast is announced to screen readers
- **Quick**: Auto-dismisses after 1.5 seconds

## Testing

To test:
1. Open sidebar
2. Click any flow (e.g., "OAuth Authorization Code")
3. Watch for:
   - Toast notification in top-right: "Switched to OAuth Authorization Code"
   - Page content fades in smoothly
4. Click a different flow
5. See new toast with different flow name

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Could add:
- Different toast colors per flow type (OAuth=blue, OIDC=green, etc.)
- Small icon in toast matching the flow type
- Sound effect (very subtle)
- Vibration on mobile devices
- Custom animations per flow category
