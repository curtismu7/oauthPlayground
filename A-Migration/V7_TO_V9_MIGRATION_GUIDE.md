# V7 to V9 Migration Guide — OAuth Playground

**Document Purpose:** Executable migration plan for upgrading V7 OAuth/OIDC flows to V9

**🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ZERO RE-TYPING POLICY**

### **MANDATORY: All V9 Flows Must Save Everything Using V9 Storage**

**EVERY V9 flow MUST implement comprehensive data persistence using `V9CredentialStorageService`:**

#### **Required Data Persistence (MANDATORY)**
1. **All Tokens** - Access tokens, refresh tokens, ID tokens, device codes
2. **All Credentials** - Client IDs, client secrets, environment IDs, API keys  
3. **All UI Entries** - Form inputs, user selections, configuration preferences
4. **All App State** - Selected applications, grant types, flow configurations

#### **User Experience Goal: ZERO RE-TYPING**
- **Objective**: Users should NEVER have to retype information they've already entered
- **Implementation**: Every field value must be automatically restored on page load
- **Persistence**: Data survives page refreshes, browser restarts, and sessions
- **Portability**: Users can export/import their complete configuration

#### **V9 Storage Implementation Pattern**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Load saved data on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  const saved = V9CredentialStorageService.loadSync(flowKey);
  if (saved.clientId) setClientId(saved.clientId);
  if (saved.environmentId) setEnvironmentId(saved.environmentId);
  if (saved.scopes) setScopes(saved.scopes);
  // Restore ALL user inputs - NO EXCEPTIONS
}, []);

// REQUIRED: Save data on every change
const handleFieldChange = (field: string, value: string) => {
  // Update state
  setState(prev => ({ ...prev, [field]: value }));
  // IMMEDIATELY persist to V9 storage
  V9CredentialStorageService.save(flowKey, { 
    ...currentState,
    [field]: value
  });
};
```

**🎯 RESULT: Users enter information once, it's available everywhere, forever.**

---

## Recent Completions (February 26, 2026)

### ✅ COMPLETED: V7 Service Dependency Analysis

**Objective:** Identify which V7 flows can be safely migrated without service refactoring.

**Analysis Results:**

Analyzed 4 CRITICAL OAuth flows:

1. **Authorization Code (V7.2)** - `OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV7_2.tsx`
   - V7 Services: ✅ None
   - V7 Config Files: `OAuthAuthzCodeFlowV7.config.ts`
   - Shared Services: comprehensiveCredentials, flowUI, unifiedTokenDisplay, etc.
   - **Migration Complexity:** ⭐ Low (only 1 config file dependency)

2. **Implicit Flow (V7)** - `ImplicitFlowV7.tsx`
   - V7 Services: ✅ None
   - V7 Config Files: ✅ None
   - Shared Services: flowUI, unifiedTokenDisplay, copyButton, etc.
   - **Migration Complexity:** ⭐ Very Low (zero V7 dependencies)

3. **Device Authorization (V7)** - `DeviceAuthorizationFlowV7.tsx`
   - V7 Services: ⚠️ `v7CredentialValidationService`
   - V7 Config Files: ✅ None
   - Shared Services: comprehensiveCredentials, flowUI, unifiedTokenDisplay, etc.
   - **Migration Complexity:** ⭐⭐ Medium (1 V7 service dependency - requires service migration)

4. **Client Credentials (V7)** - `ClientCredentialsFlowV7_Complete.tsx`
   - V7 Services: ✅ None
   - V7 Config Files: ✅ None
   - Shared Services: comprehensiveCredentials, flowUI, unifiedTokenDisplay, copyButton, flowCredential
   - **Migration Complexity:** ⭐ Very Low (zero V7 dependencies)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **75% of CRITICAL flows** (3/4) have NO V7 service dependencies
- ⚠️ **Only 1 V7-specific service** in active use: `v7CredentialValidationService`
- 📦 **Shared services** are version-agnostic and require NO changes for V9
- 🎯 **Migration strategy:** Clone V7 components to V9, update imports, archive V7 after validation

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/migration/V7_TO_V8_UPGRADE_TARGETS.md` - Documented service dependencies

**Outcome:** ✅ Clear migration path identified with minimal service refactoring needed

---

## Ground Rules (DO NOT SKIP)

- Keep changes **incremental** and **reversible**.
- Do **one flow** at a time (validate before moving to next).
- Do not refactor services broadly in the same PR as V9 flow creation.
- **Test each flow end-to-end** after migration before archiving V7 version.
- Maintain sidebar navigation during migration (both V7 and V9 available until V9 validated).
- **V9 Naming Convention:**
  - Component files: `*FlowV9.tsx` (e.g., `ImplicitFlowV9.tsx`)
  - Route paths: `/flows/*-v9` (e.g., `/flows/implicit-v9`)
  - Import paths: Reference V9 components (not V7 or V8)
- **Service Strategy:**
  - ✅ **Shared services:** Use as-is (already V9-compatible)
  - ⚠️ **V7 services:** Migrate to V9 naming before flow migration
- **Validation Requirements:**
  - Each PR must include smoke test verification
  - Check DevTools Network for successful API calls
  - Verify token display and credential handling

---

## ✅ 4-File Wiring Checklist (Every V9 Migration)

Every V9 flow migration requires **exactly 4 files** to be updated simultaneously. Missing any one will cause a subtly broken experience (broken sidebar link, missing header, dead route, etc.).

| File | What to add/change |
|---|---|
| `src/App.tsx` | Import the V9 component; add V9 `<Route>`; add V7 `<Route>` → `<Navigate to="/flows/flow-v9" />` |
| `src/config/sidebarMenuConfig.ts` | Add `['/flows/flow-v9', 'Flow Label', true]` (third element `true` marks as current) |
| `src/services/flowHeaderService.tsx` | Add entry to `FLOW_CONFIGS`: `{ title, subtitle, badge, ... }` keyed by route slug |
| `docs/migration/V9_MIGRATION_TODOS.md` | Mark flow as complete in the todos table |

### V6 Redirect Chain — Also Update When Retiring V7

When adding a V7 → V9 redirect, also check for any V6 redirects that pointed to V7:

```bash
# Check if any V6 routes point to the V7 route being retired
grep -n "flow-name-v6\|flow-name-v7" src/App.tsx
```

Update V6 → V7 redirects directly to V9 so users don't get a double-redirect chain (V6 → V7 → V9).

### Post-Wiring Smoke Test (Required)

After wiring, do these 3 checks before committing:

1. **Dev server navigation:** Open browser, navigate directly to `/flows/flow-v9` — check no Vite import errors in console
2. **V7 redirect:** Navigate to `/flows/flow-v7` — confirm it redirects to V9 cleanly
3. **Sidebar:** Confirm new V9 entry appears and the old V7 entry is either gone or unlabeled

> ⚠️ **Never rely on `tsc --noEmit` alone.** TypeScript's `baseUrl: "."` masks wrong import depths. Only the Vite dev server will catch broken relative paths. See `MIGRATION_RUNTIME_ISSUES_PREVENTION.md` for full details.
  - Test collapse/expand functionality
  - Confirm error handling works

## PR 1 — Create V9 Directory Structure & Service Migration

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

**Objective:** Establish V9 infrastructure and migrate the single V7-specific service.

---

### Task 1.1 — Create V9 directory structure

Create directories:

- `src/pages/flows/v9/`
- `src/services/v9/`
- `src/hooks/v9/` (if needed later)

Add `.gitkeep` files to each to track in git.

Acceptance:

- Directories exist and are tracked by git
- `vite dev` runs without errors

---

### Task 1.2 — Migrate v7CredentialValidationService to V9

**Context:** This is the ONLY V7-specific service in active use (only used by DeviceAuthorizationFlowV7).

Create file:

- `src/services/v9/v9CredentialValidationService.tsx`

Steps:

1. Copy content from `src/services/v7CredentialValidationService.tsx`
2. Rename class/exports from `v7*` to `v9*`
3. Update any V7-specific logic if needed (verify with original service)
4. Update imports in service to use V9 paths if referencing other services

**Example rename:**
```typescript
// Before (V7):
class V7CredentialValidationService {
  // ...
}

// After (V9):
class V9CredentialValidationService {
  // ...
}
```

Create test file:

- `src/services/v9/__tests__/v9CredentialValidationService.test.ts`

Copy from:

- `src/services/__tests__/v7CredentialValidationService.test.ts`

Update all `v7*` references to `v9*` in test file.

Acceptance:

- `npm test` passes for v9CredentialValidationService
- Service exports correctly
- No V7 imports remain in V9 service

Rollback (PR 1):

- Delete `src/services/v9/` directory
- Delete `src/pages/flows/v9/` directory

---

## PR 2 — Migrate Implicit Flow V7 to V9 (Zero Dependencies)

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL (simplest migration - zero V7 dependencies)

**Rationale:** Start with the easiest flow to establish V9 migration pattern.

---

### Task 2.1 — Create ImplicitFlowV9.tsx

Create file:

- `src/pages/flows/v9/ImplicitFlowV9.tsx`

Steps:

1. Copy entire content from `src/pages/flows/ImplicitFlowV7.tsx`
2. Update component name: `ImplicitFlowV7` → `ImplicitFlowV9`
3. Update all V7 references to V9 in comments/documentation
4. Verify imports - should all be shared services (no V7 services)
5. Update page title/heading to indicate "V9"

Expected imports (all shared services):
```typescript
import FlowUIService from '../../services/flowUIService';
import { UnifiedTokenDisplayService } from '../../services/unifiedTokenDisplayService';
import { CopyButtonService } from '../../services/copyButtonService';
// No v7* imports expected
```

Acceptance:

- Component file created and exports `ImplicitFlowV9`
- No V7 service imports remain
- TypeScript compilation succeeds

---

### Task 2.2 — Add V9 Implicit Flow route

Edit file:

<Route
  path="/flows/implicit-v7"
  element={<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}><ImplicitFlowV7 /></Suspense>}
/>
```

Add NEW V9 route below it:

```tsx
<Route
  path="/flows/implicit-v9"
  element={<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}><ImplicitFlowV9 /></Suspense>}
/>
```

Add lazy import at top of file (with other lazy imports):

```tsx
const ImplicitFlowV9 = lazy(() => import('./pages/flows/v9/ImplicitFlowV9'));
```

**Do NOT remove V7 route yet** - keep both during validation.

Acceptance:

- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/flows/implicit-v9` successfully loads
- V7 route still works at `/flows/implicit-v7`
- No console errors

---

### Task 2.3 — Add V9 Implicit Flow to sidebar

  label: 'OAuth 2.0 Flows',
  items: [
    // ... existing items ...
    {
      icon: <i className="mdi mdi-connection" aria-hidden="true" />,
      label: 'Implicit Flow (V7)', // Keep V7
      path: '/flows/implicit-v7',
      badge: 'V7'
    },
    {
      icon: <i className="mdi mdi-connection" aria-hidden="true" />,

      path: '/flows/implicit-v9',
      badge: 'V9'
    },
    // ... other flows ...
  ]
}
```

Also add to OpenID Connect menu group if it exists there.

// DELETE these lazy imports:
const ImplicitFlowV7 = lazy(...);
const ClientCredentialsFlowV7_Complete = lazy(...);
const OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV7_2 = lazy(...);
const DeviceAuthorizationFlowV7 = lazy(...);
```

Acceptance:

- V7 routes no longer accessible
- V9 routes still work
- App compiles successfully

---

### Task 6.2 — Remove V7 sidebar entries

Edit file:

- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

Remove all V7 entries for the 4 CRITICAL flows:

```tsx
// DELETE these sidebar items:
// - Implicit Flow (V7)
// - Client Credentials (V7)
// - Authorization Code (V7.2)
// - Device Authorization (V7)
```

Keep only V9 entries, update labels to remove "(V9)" suffix since V7 deprecated:

```tsx
// Before:
label: 'Implicit Flow (V9)'

// After:
label: 'Implicit Flow'
// Keep badge: 'V9' for now
```

Acceptance:

- Sidebar shows only V9 flows
- No V7 entries visible
- Navigation works correctly

---

### Task 6.3 — Archive V7 component files

Move V7 component files to archive:

Create directory:

- `archived/v7/pages/flows/`
- `archived/v7/pages/flows/config/`

Move these files:

```bash
# Component files
mv src/pages/flows/ImplicitFlowV7.tsx archived/v7/pages/flows/
mv src/pages/flows/ClientCredentialsFlowV7_Complete.tsx archived/v7/pages/flows/
mv src/pages/flows/OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV7_2.tsx archived/v7/pages/flows/
mv src/pages/flows/DeviceAuthorizationFlowV7.tsx archived/v7/pages/flows/

# Config file
mv src/pages/flows/config/OAuthAuthzCodeFlowV7.config.ts archived/v7/pages/flows/config/
```

Acceptance:

- Files moved to archive
- `vite dev` builds successfully
- No import errors

---

### Task 6.4 — Archive V7 services

Move V7-specific services to archive:

Create directory:

- `archived/v7/services/`
- `archived/v7/services/__tests__/`

Move these files:

```bash
# Service file
mv src/services/v7CredentialValidationService.tsx archived/v7/services/

# Test file
mv src/services/__tests__/v7CredentialValidationService.test.ts archived/v7/services/__tests__/
```

Acceptance:

- V7 service archived
- No import errors (V9 flows use V9CredentialValidationService)
- Tests pass (`npm test`)

---

### Task 6.5 — Update documentation

Edit files:

- `docs/migration/V7_TO_V8_UPGRADE_TARGETS.md`
- `README.md` (if V7 mentioned)

Add section to V7_TO_V8_UPGRADE_TARGETS.md:

```markdown

## 📊 Migration Session Metrics

**PRs Planned:** 6
**PRs Completed:** 5 / 6
**Flows Migrated:** 4 / 4 CRITICAL ✅

**V9 Files Created:**
- Component files: 4 ✅ (Implicit, Client Credentials, Auth Code, Device Authorization)
- Service files: 1 ✅ (v9CredentialValidationService)
- Config files: 1 ✅ (OAuthAuthzCodeFlowV9.config)
- Test files: 1 ✅ (v9CredentialValidationService.test)
- Total: 7 files created

**V7 Files to Archive (After PR 6):**
- Component files: 4
- Service files: 1
- Config files: 1
- Test files: 1
- Total: 7 files to archive

**Migration Complexity Actual:**
- ⭐ Very Low: 2 flows (Implicit, Client Credentials) - zero V7 dependencies ✅
- ⭐⭐ Low: 1 flow (Auth Code) - 1 config file dependency ✅
- ⭐⭐⭐ Medium: 1 flow (Device Authorization) - 1 V7 service dependency ✅

**Estimated Timeline vs Actual:**
- **Planned:** 6 weeks (1 PR per week)
- **Actual:** 2 days (Feb 26-27, 2026)
- **Efficiency:** 21x faster than estimated

**Issues Encountered:**
1. ✅ Import path issues in V9 files (fixed with sed script)
2. ✅ Missing v4ToastMessages.ts (restored from archive)
3. ✅ TypeScript linting errors (all fixed except minor React hook warnings)
4. ✅ Unused lazy-loaded components in App.tsx (removed)

---

## 🔄 Current Status

**Active Work:** ✅ **MIGRATION COMPLETE** (All 5 PRs executed successfully)

**Completion Date:** February 27, 2026

**Next Action:** Validate V9 flows in production for 1 week before archiving V7 files (PR 6)

**Blockers:** None

**Production Status:**
- ✅ All 4 CRITICAL V9 flows are live and accessible
- ✅ V7 flows remain active for backward compatibility
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ⚠️ Minor React hook linting warnings (non-blocking, inherited from V7)

**Testing Status:**
- ⏳ Manual smoke testing required for each V9 flow
- ⏳ End-to-end validation needed before archiving V7
- ⏳ 1 week production monitoring period before PR 6

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ V9 flows may have subtle behavioral differences from V7
- ⚠️ Shared services may have hidden V7 dependencies not yet discovered
- ⚠️ Production endpoints may behave differently with V9 flows

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Thorough smoke testing required for each PR
- ✅ Keep V7 and V9 active simultaneously during validation period
- ✅ Monitor production errors for 1 week before archiving V7
- ✅ Rollback plan documented for each PR

## � Credentials Import/Export Service (NEW - March 2026)

**Status:** ✅ **STANDARDIZED** - Service and component available

### Overview
All flows with credentials should use the standardized import/export service for consistent user experience.

### Service Location
- **Service**: `src/services/credentialsImportExportService.ts`
- **Component**: `src/components/CredentialsImportExport.tsx`
- **Version**: 9.0.0

### Implementation Pattern for V9 Flows
V9 flows already have comprehensive credentials management through `ComprehensiveCredentialsService`. For non-V9 flows:

```tsx
import { CredentialsImportExport } from '@/components/CredentialsImportExport';

// Add near credential inputs
<CredentialsImportExport
  credentials={credentials}
  options={{
    flowType: 'your-flow-type',
    appName: 'Your Flow Name',
    onImportSuccess: (creds) => setCredentials(creds),
    onImportError: (error) => console.error(error),
  }}
/>
```

### File Format
Export creates JSON with standardized structure including flow type, version, and metadata.

### Implementation Status
- ✅ V9 Flows: All 16 use `ComprehensiveCredentialsService`
- 🔄 Non-V9 Flows: 3/13 have standardized import/export
- 📋 **See**: `CREDENTIALS_IMPORT_EXPORT_INVENTORY.md` for complete inventory

### Required Imports
```typescript
import { CredentialsImportExport } from '@/components/CredentialsImportExport';
import { credentialsImportExportService } from '@/services/credentialsImportExportService';
```

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback Procedure

If critical issue discovered with V9 flows:

1. **DO NOT** restore V7 routes immediately
2. Identify specific failing flow
3. Create hotfix PR to fix V9 issue
4. If hotfix cannot be completed quickly (<2 hours):
   - Temporarily restore specific V7 route only
   - Add banner warning users V7 is deprecated
   - Create critical bug ticket for V9 fix
5. Fix V9 issue and re-validate
6. Remove temporary V7 route once V9 fixed

**V7 Restoration Commands (Emergency Only):**

```bash
# Restore specific V7 component from archive
cp archived/v7/pages/flows/[FlowName].tsx src/pages/flows/

# Re-add V7 route to App.tsx (manually)
# Re-add V7 sidebar entry (manually)

# If service needed:
cp archived/v7/services/v7CredentialValidationService.tsx src/services/
```
