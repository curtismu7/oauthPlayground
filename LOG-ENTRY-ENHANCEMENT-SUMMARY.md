# Log Entry Expansion and Visual Cues Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed log entry expansion issues and enhanced visual cues on the Logs page to provide a more reliable, accessible, and visually appealing user experience.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. First Click Expansion Reliability
**Problem**: Log entries sometimes required multiple clicks to expand due to conflicting event handlers and state management issues.

**Solution**: 
- **Unified Event Handling**: Removed conflicting event handlers from `app.js` and consolidated all expansion logic in `log-manager.js`
- **Synchronous State Management**: Implemented immediate state updates with proper event prevention
- **Reliable Toggle Logic**: Enhanced click handler with explicit expand/collapse state management
- **Event Propagation Control**: Added proper `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to prevent conflicts

### 2. Enhanced Arrow Icon Visibility and Behavior
**Problem**: Expand/collapse icons were too small, lacked visual feedback, and had poor accessibility.

**Solution**:
- **Larger, Bolder Icons**: Increased icon size from 0.8em to 1.2em with bold font weight
- **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: Added hover states with scale transform (1.1x) and color changes
- **Smooth Animations**: Implemented 0.3s transitions for all icon state changes
- **Better Positioning**: Added proper padding, border-radius, and background for better visibility
- **Rotation Animation**: Icons now rotate 90 degrees when expanded with smooth transitions

### 3. Improved Expanded Text Readability
**Problem**: Expanded content lacked visual separation and had poor readability.

**Solution**:
- **Background Styling**: Added gradient background (`linear-gradient(135deg, #f8f9fa 0%, #e9ecef 100%)`) for better visual separation
- **Enhanced Typography**: Improved font families, sizes, and line heights for better readability
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Added proper spacing, borders, and section dividers
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced JSON display with monospace fonts and proper formatting
- **Smooth Animations**: Added slide-down animation for expanded content

### 4. Accessibility and Feedback Improvements
**Problem**: Limited keyboard accessibility and poor screen reader support.

**Solution**:
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Added full keyboard support (Tab, Enter, Space, Escape)
- **ARIA Attributes**: Implemented proper `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`, and `role` attributes
- **Focus Management**: Added focus indicators and proper focus state styling
- **Screen Reader Support**: Hidden decorative icons with `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Semantic Structure**: Added proper `role="region"` for expanded content areas
