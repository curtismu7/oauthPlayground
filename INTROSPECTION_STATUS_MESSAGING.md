# Token Introspection Status Messaging - Improved

## Problem
When introspection returns `{ "active": false }`, the UI was showing "❌ Inactive" for all cases, even when the token was actually expired.

## Solution
Added logic to check the `exp` (expiration) claim and show appropriate status:

### Status Messages
1. **✅ Active** - Token is valid and active
2. **❌ Expired** - Token has `active: false` AND has an `exp` claim that's in the past
3. **❌ Inactive** - Token has `active: false` for other reasons (revoked, wrong client, etc.)

### Logic Implemented
```typescript
{introspectionResults.active 
  ? '✅ Active' 
  : introspectionResults.exp && Date.now() >= introspectionResults.exp * 1000
    ? '❌ Expired'
    : '❌ Inactive'}
```

### Files Updated
- ✅ `src/components/TokenIntrospect.tsx` (line ~551)
- ✅ `src/components/TokenIntrospectionStep.tsx` (line ~419)

## Why This Helps

**Before:**
```
Token Status: ❌ Inactive
```
User thinks: "Why is it inactive? What's wrong?"

**After (if expired):**
```
Token Status: ❌ Expired
```
User thinks: "Ah, it's expired. I need a fresh token."

**After (if revoked/invalid):**
```
Token Status: ❌ Inactive
```
User knows it's not just an expiration issue.

## Testing

1. Get a fresh token and introspect immediately → Should show "✅ Active"
2. Wait for token to expire (1 hour) and introspect → Should show "❌ Expired"
3. Try to introspect with wrong client ID → Should show "❌ Inactive"

## Note on PingOne Behavior

PingOne's introspection endpoint returns `{ "active": false }` for MULTIPLE reasons:
- Token is expired
- Token was revoked
- Token doesn't belong to this client
- Token is malformed

By checking the `exp` claim, we can provide better UX by distinguishing between "expired" and "other problems".
