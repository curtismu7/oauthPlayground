   - Has CollapsibleHeader import ✅
   - Local components removed ✅  
   - Needs testing to verify it's not broken ⚠️

## ⏸️ Started But Reverted (Safe)

5. **OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx** ⏸️
   - CollapsibleHeader import added ✅
   - Local components RESTORED ✅

## 📋 Recommended Action Plan

### Option 1: Pause & Test (Recommended)
1. ✅ Test `OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV6.tsx` (should work now)
2. ✅ Test `PingOnePARFlowV6_New.tsx` (verify not broken)
3. ⏸️ Pause migration work
4. 🧪 User tests all currently working flows
5. 📊 Plan next steps based on findings

### Option 2: Finish PingOnePARFlowV6_New (Quick Fix)
1. ✅ Complete remaining 7 sections in `PingOnePARFlowV6_New.tsx`
2. ✅ Test thoroughly
3. ⏸️ Then pause and wait for feedback

### Option 3: Continue with Proper Pattern
1. ✅ Use "Keep Both Components" pattern
2. ✅ Migrate 1-2 flows completely
3. ✅ Test each one
4. ✅ Continue only if successful

## 🛡️ Lessons Learned

### ❌ Wrong Approach (Caused Error):
- Remove styled components first
- Try to migrate sections later
- **Result:** Broken app!

### ✅ Correct Approach (Use Going Forward):
1. Add `CollapsibleHeader` import
2. **KEEP** old styled components in place
3. Migrate sections one by one or all at once
4. Test thoroughly
5. **ONLY THEN** remove old styled components

## 🎯 Immediate Actions Required

**Before ANY further migration:**

1. **Test Current State:**
   ```bash
   # Open browser to:
   # https://localhost:3000/flows/oauth-authorization-code-v6
   # https://localhost:3000/flows/pingone-par-v6
   # Verify both load without errors
   ```

2. **Document What's Working:**
   - List which flows are confirmed working
   - List any flows that are broken
   - Prioritize fixes over new migrations

3. **Decision Point:**
   - Continue with migration? (Using correct pattern)
   - Pause and focus on testing?
   - Revert partial migrations and start fresh?
