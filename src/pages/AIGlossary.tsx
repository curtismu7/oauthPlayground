						'A personal AI assistant attempting to connect to an enterprise API may stall if the API requires manual DCR approval, preventing spontaneous agent-to-service collaboration.',
					relatedTerms: ['Client Metadata', 'OAuth 2.1'],

				{
					term: 'Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD)',
					definition:
						'An emerging IETF OAuth Working Group draft that lets authorization servers resolve a client_id as an HTTPS URL pointing to rich metadata. Instead of pre-registering every agent, servers can fetch the metadata document when needed, enabling open ecosystems.

					term: 'Identity Assertion Authorization Grant (ID-JAG)',
					definition:
						'A proposed OAuth grant that allows applications to present an identity assertion from a trusted enterprise identity provider and exchange it for API access tokens. It builds on RFC 8693 Token Exchange and the JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grants to support cross-application delegation for AI agents.

				},
				{
					term: 'OAuth Identity and Authorization Chaining',
					definition:
						'An IETF draft that preserves authoritative identity and authorization context as tokens move across multiple trust domains. Chaining ensures downstream services can verify who initiated a request and under which policy.

					term: 'Model Context Protocol (MCP)',
					definition:
						'An open protocol for connecting AI clients and servers. The community is evaluating CIMD as an alternative to traditional DCR so personal agents can register on the fly.
