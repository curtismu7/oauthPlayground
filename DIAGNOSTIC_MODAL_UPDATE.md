# Diagnostic Modal - Authentication Failure Support

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Modal Now Shows on Authentication Failures**

Previously, the modal only showed when credentials were **empty**. Now it also shows when:
- ❌ PingOne rejects the credentials (401 Unauthorized)
- ❌ INVALID_TOKEN error
- ❌ Any authentication failure

### 2. **Enhanced Error Display**

The modal now shows:
```
🔐 Authentication Method: Basic Auth header sent to PingOne
🆔 Client ID (sent): bdb78dcc...
🔑 Client Secret (sent): VhIA...LJEq (64 chars)
❌ PingOne Error: The request could not be completed...
⚠️ Error Code: INVALID_TOKEN
💡 Possible Causes: Check: 1) Client Secret matches...
```

### 3. **No Immediate Throw**

Previously:
```typescript
setShowDiagnosticModal(true);
throw new Error(errorMessage); // Modal closed immediately!
```

Now:
```typescript
setShowDiagnosticModal(true);
setLoading(false);
return; // Let modal stay open!
```

### 4. **Authorization URL Validation - `response_mode=pi.flow` Support**

Updated `authorizationUrlValidationService.ts` to:
- ✅ Parse `response_mode` parameter
- ✅ Parse `login_hint_token` parameter
- ✅ Detect `response_mode=pi.flow` as redirectless flow
- ✅ Log when redirectless flow is detected

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Fill in the credentials on PingOne Authentication page
2. Click HEB Login
3. Enter username/password
4. **If credentials are invalid**, you'll now see:
   - 🎯 **Diagnostic Modal** with full details
   - ❌ Error message from PingOne
   - 📊 What was sent (Client ID, Client Secret lengths)
   - 💡 Possible causes and fixes

## 📝 Key Points

1. **Modal stays open** - Doesn't close immediately on error
2. **Shows what was sent** - Not empty, but invalid
3. **Shows PingOne's error** - INVALID_TOKEN
4. **Provides guidance** - Possible causes and fixes
5. **User can review** - Before closing or retrying

This solves your issue: "I see no debug messages, and no modal on screen to tell me anything is blank."

Now you'll see:
- ✅ Debug messages in console
- ✅ Modal on screen showing the problem
- ✅ Clear indication that credentials were sent but rejected by PingOne
