# ✅ Variant Selector Defaults Fixed

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Issue:** Flow variant selectors were defaulting to wrong variants based on user navigation intent

---

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

When users navigate to flows from the menu, the variant selectors should default to the appropriate variant:
- **OAuth 2.0 flows** → Should default to `'oauth'`
- **OpenID Connect flows** → Should default to `'oidc'`
- **Unified flows** → Should default to the base protocol (`'oauth'` for most cases)

---

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. ImplicitFlowV7.tsx**
**Route:** `/flows/implicit-v7` ("Implicit Flow V7")
**Issue:** Was defaulting to `'oidc'`
**Fix:** Changed to default to `'oauth'`

```tsx
// Before
const [selectedVariant, setSelectedVariant] = useState<'oauth' | 'oidc'>('oidc');

// After  
const [selectedVariant, setSelectedVariant] = useState<'oauth' | 'oidc'>('oauth');
```

**Reasoning:** OAuth 2.0 Implicit is the original/base flow, OIDC Implicit is an extension

### **2. DeviceAuthorizationFlowV7.tsx**
**Route:** `/flows/device-authorization-v7` ("Device Authorization V7")
**Issue:** Was defaulting to `'oidc'`
**Fix:** Changed to default to `'oauth'`

```tsx
// Before
const [selectedVariant, setSelectedVariant] = useState<'oauth' | 'oidc'>('oidc');

// After
const [selectedVariant, setSelectedVariant] = useState<'oauth' | 'oidc'>('oauth');
```

**Reasoning:** Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) is primarily an OAuth 2.0 flow

## ✅ **Verified Correct Defaults**

### **Flows Already Correct:**
- **OAuthAuthorizationCodeFlowV7_Condensed_Mock** → `'oauth'` ✅
- **OAuthImplicitFlowV6** → No variant selector (OAuth-only) ✅
- **OIDCImplicitFlowV6_Full** → `defaultFlowVariant: 'oidc'` ✅

### **Separate Flow Architecture (V6):**
- `/flows/oauth-implicit-v6` → **OAuthImplicitFlowV6** (OAuth-only) ✅
- `/flows/oidc-implicit-v6` → **OIDCImplicitFlowV6** (OIDC-only) ✅

---

## 🎯 **User Experience Impact**

### **Before Fix:**
- User clicks "OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow" → Flow opens with OIDC selected ❌
- User clicks "Device Authorization V7" → Flow opens with OIDC selected ❌

### **After Fix:**
- User clicks "OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow" → Flow opens with OAuth selected ✅
- User clicks "OpenID Connect Implicit Flow" → Flow opens with OIDC selected ✅
- User clicks "Implicit Flow V7" → Flow opens with OAuth selected ✅
- User clicks "Device Authorization V7" → Flow opens with OAuth selected ✅

---

## 📊 **Architecture Summary**

### **V6 Flows (Separate Components):**
- **OAuth flows** → Dedicated OAuth components
- **OIDC flows** → Dedicated OIDC components
- **No variant selectors needed**

### **V7 Flows (Unified Components):**
- **Single components** with variant selectors
- **Default to base protocol** (OAuth for most flows)
- **Users can switch** between OAuth/OIDC as needed

---

## 🧪 **Validation**

### **✅ Syntax Validation:**
- ImplicitFlowV7.tsx: No TypeScript errors
- DeviceAuthorizationFlowV7.tsx: No TypeScript errors

### **✅ User Flow Testing:**
1. Navigate to "Implicit Flow V7" → Opens with OAuth selected ✅
2. Navigate to "Device Authorization V7" → Opens with OAuth selected ✅
3. Users can still switch to OIDC variant when needed ✅
4. Separate V6 flows maintain their dedicated variants ✅

---

## 🎉 **Result**

The variant selector defaults now match user expectations based on menu navigation:
- **OAuth menu items** → OAuth variant selected by default
- **OIDC menu items** → OIDC variant selected by default  
- **Unified flows** → Base protocol (OAuth) selected by default
- **User choice preserved** → Users can still switch variants as needed

This provides a much more intuitive user experience while maintaining the flexibility of unified V7 flows! 🚀

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Impact:** Improved UX for flow variant selection
