# Backups Directory

This directory contains backup files and previous versions of important application files.

## 📁 Files

### Server Files
- **server_new.js** - Previous version of the main server file
- **server_new_fixed.js** - Fixed version of the server
- **server_fixed.js** - Another fixed version of the server
- **server.mjs** - ES module version of the server

### Client Files
- **pingone-client_fixed.js** - Fixed version of the PingOne client

## 🔄 Purpose

These files serve as:
- **Backup copies** of important application files
- **Previous versions** for rollback if needed
- **Reference implementations** for development
- **Safety net** in case of issues with current versions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Do Not Use in Production
- These files are **backup copies only**
- Use the current versions in the root directory
- These may contain outdated code or configurations

### Development Only
- Use for reference when debugging
- Compare with current versions for changes
- May contain experimental features

## 🧹 Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
- Review backup files quarterly
- Remove outdated backups (older than 6 months)
- Keep only the most recent versions
- Document any important changes

### Version Control
- These files are **not tracked in git**
- Keep local copies for safety
- Consider archiving important versions
