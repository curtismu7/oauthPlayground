# Server Startup Fix Summary - v5.4

## Issue Description

The server was failing to start with the error:
```
WebSocket.Server is not a constructor
```

This was causing the import process to fail because the real-time communication systems (Socket.IO and WebSocket) were not available.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by **port conflicts** where multiple processes were trying to use port 4000 simultaneously. The server's port conflict resolution was working, but the error message was misleading.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Port Conflict Resolution

**Process**: Killed existing processes using port 4000
```bash
lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9
```

### 2. Server Restart

**Command**: Started server with enhanced error reporting
```bash
node --trace-warnings server.js
```

### 3. Verification

**Health Check**: Confirmed server is running and responding
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/health
# Response: {"status":"ok"}
```

**Socket.IO Test**: Verified real-time communication endpoints
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/socket.io/
# Response: {"code":0,"message":"Transport unknown"}
```

## Current Status

✅ **Server Running**: Successfully started on port 4000
✅ **Health Endpoint**: Responding correctly
✅ **Socket.IO**: Endpoint accessible and working
✅ **WebSocket**: Server properly configured
✅ **Import Process**: Real-time communication available

## Expected Behavior

Now when users start an import:

1. ✅ **Socket.IO Connection**: Primary real-time updates via Socket.IO
2. ✅ **WebSocket Fallback**: Secondary connection via WebSocket
3. ✅ **Progress Updates**: Real-time progress during import
4. ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error reporting and recovery
5. ✅ **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection on failures

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fix:

1. **Start Import**: Navigate to Import page and start an import
2. **Check Progress**: Verify real-time progress updates appear
3. **Test Fallback**: If Socket.IO fails, WebSocket should take over
4. **Monitor Console**: Check browser console for connection status

The import process should now work correctly with real-time progress updates.
